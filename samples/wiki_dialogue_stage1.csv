You're the first fairy to have

achieved such mastery over the door on your back.
But I do have a question

as to the way you fought.
You managed to outwit me by

drawing power from the gap between seasons,

それぞれの季節と季節の間には、春夏秋冬の

どの季節にも属さない瞬間というのがある
その瞬間は自然の力が衰え

私に挑んできたのだ
偶然か必然か、それが原因で

その力を奪って強制退出出来なくなった
その事に私は驚いたんだよ

","
When one season transitions into another, there exists a moment

that belongs to neither spring, summer, fall, or winter.
In that moment, the power of nature weakens,

and mental energy wins out over life energy.
And for whatever reason, you chose to challenge me with

that moment--the worst possible moment for a fairy.
Whether it was a coincidence or fate, that fact prevented me

from stealing your power and forcibly ejecting you.
That's what at first surprised me,

and then intrigued me.

A swallowtail butterfly fairy, was it?

I see...
Normally that should have been a summer door.
It's possible that she wasn't a butterfly fairy at all,

but  Tokoyo no Kami (God of the Everlasting Night)  instead.
A god who is one of my enemies.
In which case, I can't imagine this was a coincidence.

カードは大天狗が作った

","
The cards are a type of magic item
that the great tengu created.
They seem to be utilizing dragon gems,
which can seal souls within them,
but the detailed mechanism behind them is a mystery to me.
After all, the dragon gems alone shouldn't be sufficient
for maintaining the cards' supply of magic.

I can't do that.
The cards' circulation can't be stopped; not by me, at least.
Because everyone who's taking part in the card trade
just started doing so of their own accord.
And I'm not the one controlling
their circulation, either.
If you do seriously want to stop that circulation, I suggest
you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.

Dreams invade your mind more than reality itself.
