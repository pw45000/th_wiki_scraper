","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","""..Hm, but what will I put inside the shrine?
","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","I've never seen the insides of the Hakurei Shrine...
","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","Since it is the place where a god lives,
","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","Maybe I should put in a little cushion or something.
","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","I guess that god I just met could live in here.""

"Kanako","""If you bestow my name on a shrine, it'll become a

","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","Don't you mean you forced your way in?""
","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","""You must've known I was trying to go against a god!""","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","""You'd need a reason like that to get up the mountain.
","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"

"Nitori","""You don't need to fight Lady Yasaka anymore.
","Marisa","Endings","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","""Well, fine.
 Clinging to cherry blossoms even after one's death...

 That's really pathetic, isn't it.""
","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","""So what was the point of it all?
 Did I learn that my own home is best?""

 once the black thing goes home, Youmu.""
","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

"Yuyuko","""I will, naturally.""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","""That's not a fair gamble.""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","""No one said we were making a bet.

"Marisa","""Who said I was riding on the bet?""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","""Dunno.""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","""Besides, this is no checkmate.

"Youmu","""... After these feasts.""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

 I came all the way here just to see this, too.""

"Youmu","""Promised?""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","""And since when did you two become ghosts?""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","""It's easy enough to come here without dying.""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","""Eh? But there's the barrier.""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","""It disappeared as soon as Reimu touched it.""","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","""So don't touch it.
 That applies especially to people like her.""

"Yuyuko","""Youmu, finish cleaning as soon as possible.
 We have some honoured guests today.""

"Marisa","""Us, of course.
 In your face!""
","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","""Ah, you're already here.
","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","""It's nice to be invited, but...
 I didn't want to be invited by a ghost.""
","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","""Anyway, Youmu, we're hosting a flower viewing feast today.

 Spring has arrived in your world as well,

 why don't you go back?""

 I am a rare and honoured human guest here.""
","Marisa","Endings","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

 our cherry petals to be blown away.""

"Marisa","""They'll be blown away whether I'm here or not.
 I'm sure of it.""

 That's as good as being revived!""

some of the energy with me.""

I don't really think those guys there are phantoms.

","Marisa","Endings","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","""Hm, it sure is a lot of energy.
","Marisa","Endings","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","Maybe enough to pile it as high as a mountain.

into a Gensokyo sightseeing cruise ship.""

years, along with my companions like Ichirin and Shou.""
","Reimu","Endings","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

","Reimu","Endings","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","I don't think I'd mind wandering around forever, though.

"Reimu","""Hey, now, you can't just fly around forever.
","Reimu","Endings","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","This ship's gonna cast huge shadows everywhere.""

in the Animal Realm. Don't you think?""

"Keiki","""The Netherworld turned us down, you see. They said they already have too many ghosts.
","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","And since the human spirits from the Animal Realm aren't the type to laze around,
they might not be suited for the Netherworld.""
","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

the Animal Realm was even more suffocating.""

","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","""The Animal Realm is a world without gods, and almost all spirits,
including me, are treated as slaves. That's the natural way of things.

"Yachie","Even so, the human spirits made a frightening choice.""
","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

"Reimu","""Yeah, about that...""","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","""Some stuff happened, and I kinda
ended up working with an eagle spirit.

"Reimu","""They're sight-seeing.
","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","And paying. It's pretty profitable.""
","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

"Reimu","""You again?
","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","You keep coming back to visit, huh.""
","Reimu","Endings","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

if I came to the Human Realm.""

 Come on, things like this are necessary once in a while.""

 Are you saying that Reimu's sake isn't good enough to drink?""

 Won't you calm down a little and have some more sake?""
","Reimu_and_Yukari","Endings","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","""I'm awake all this time now.
 The noisy time as well as the unnoisy time became noisy.""

 I'll impartially support this degree of fun.""

 than the shrine where the moon looks so beautiful.""

There's your answer!

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"

Oho... I see that the door on your back right now...
corresponds to doyou, the border between seasons
where the world loses its vitality entirely.

How's THAT?
With this, even if you tried to kick me out,
there's nowhere for me to go!

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"

I don't think it'll work out very well in the end,

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
How interesting!
I'd already rejected you,
but you've made me reconsider.
I must admit I'm quite taken by your wisdom and boldness.
You can consider your rejection nullified.
Now let us begin the final test, once again!
This time I won't be using the energy of the seasons!

So with that, you have the job!
I'll allow you to work for me.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"

what would happen to those two?

they'll remain as they are forever.

stop the 'four seasons' incident now?
If the forest stays winter any longer,
I don't even wanna think about my heating bill.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"

The four seasons incident is a side effect of the back doors.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Everyone living in Gensokyo, especially the other sages.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"

You do realize that gods are required to do that, don't you?

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Ah, right.
We do have more than a few folks like that.
Well, whatever. The incident is gonna settle down now, right?
There wasn't any major damage,
so I'll let you off with that.
In exchange, just tell everyone that I'm the one who resolved it, okay?

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

of Gensokyo now, too.

Dreams invade your mind more than reality.
Your lunatic dream isn't over yet!

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

for them arrive at this answer.

I thought they'd realize it right away...

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

Huh, so it was you after all.
Those moon people still haven't
pulled out of Gensokyo.
What are you up to this time?

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were
unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin
into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself!
Hecatia, goddess of hell!

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Ah, no. Your enemy is the human
before you, not the moon's people.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Human?
For real? Like, they're physically here?
Hmm...
Let's have a look-see.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
W-what's with you?
Quit starin' at me.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Well, all right.
So this human's been giving you a hard time, Junko?

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
It wasn't merely a 'hard time'.
It's thanks to this human that we
were defeated, albeit only halfway.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Whaaaat?
She's that strong...?

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
That aside, what are you guys anyway?
If you're enemies of the moon's people,
we might have a common interest, here...

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Kanako","
Oh, do you mean to go further ahead?
You may not ? there rests my ever-sleeping friend.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Junko","
Our enemy is Chang'e,
the leader of the moon rabbits.
She is the wife of the man
who stole my son's life away.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
And the wife of the guy who killed one of my stars.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Huh. So it's dictionary-definition revenge, then?
(Don't quite get that 'killed a star' thing,)
(but maybe I shouldn't pry.)
But, eh,
sorry 'bout all this.
Now you gotta give up on your revenge for our sake, an' all.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
It's all right.
We have endless opportunities.
Yes, this revenge drama will
repeat itself for all eternity.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
A'ight then.
You get the moon involved, an' just about everything takes forever.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Hey, is it okay if I come over to
your place to play next time?
With even a human this powerful,
I'd practically never get bored.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Uh, aren't you a hell goddess?
Really don't like idea of you raisin' hell over there.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Nah, it's fine. As long as I'm on
Earth, I'm an Earth goddess.

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
That so...?

","Marisa","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
If you're giving up the shrine so freely,
you must have gotten something really nice in return.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Geh.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
She took over it?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Well, faith in me has risen since then, so
I guess I'm grateful for that, but...

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
The world of the gods sure seems tough.
Welp, now that I know more about the secrets of the shrine,
I guess I'll just be...

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
What are you saying?
I can't just let a visitor leave just like that
after coming all the way to the inner sanctum, can I?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Oh, do you have a present for me?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Since you made it into the shrine, you'll have to do
like you did with Sanae and Kanako...
You'll have to have a danmaku festival with me!

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Ahahahaha. Simply admirable for a human to defeat a god who's built up a country by herself.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
I'm your senior when it comes to danmaku, so there's no way I could lose.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
For a human to be on the same level as a god in danmaku play...
Gensokyo sure has some pretty sharp people.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
That's basically because everyone's really smart.
Well, almost everyone.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Alright, It's settled! I'll take up residence in Gensokyo, too.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Isn't that why you came here in the first place, or were you still thinking about going back?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Oh, Kanako moved the shrine here on her own, that's all.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Oh, really?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
But, Kanako must have been able to see it...
That a second life awaits us gods here in Gensokyo.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Hey now, it wouldn't be any good if all the gods from the outside came here, you know?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Gensokyo isn't that big, so I don't think that'd happen.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Well, whatever. If you're going to live here, try preparing for a feast once in a while.
The youkai won't stand for it if you don't. And I won't, either.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Oh, scary.
If that's the case, we'd better start planning a big feast right away. I'll get 44 reeds for rice gruel right away.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
A party with rice gruel... the outside world's drinking traditions are pure chaos.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Exactly.

I only collected power from the turning point of the seasons.
The gap between seasons, where the vitality of the four seasons is lost,

and where all the evil in the world rears its head!

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Heh heh. So if I absorb and release that,

I'll destroy myself with the tengu's evil power.
But if you had stayed quiet, I might not have realized.

Why tell me?

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I figured that a god such as yourself

would be sure to figure it out anyway.
And I'm not here to destroy you, either.
I don't want to ensnare you in some cowardly trap.

I just wanted to nullify the one you used.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Heh heh heh.

So you wish to fight fair and square, is it?
Very well then. To honor your courage,

I won't use any seasonal energy.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
It's less that I want a fair match,

and more that I just want to interview you.
You're a god of impairments who shares

an ancestor with us tengu, after all.
I'd like to know more about the history of outcasts from society

such as yourself and what you're going to do in the future.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Very well. If you win, I'll give you

an interview and whatever else.
After all, Gensokyo's origins cannot be told of

without including us impaired people as well.
See it! Hear it! Speak of it!

Behold the true form of the impaired, hidden god!

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
*Pant* *Pant*

Had enough yet?!

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Splendid!

That's more than enough, I understand your strength now.
This is my loss.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
...No, it's my loss.
Without this magic at my back,

I wouldn't have stood a chance against you.
And that power is ultimately yours.

This fight was built on the basic assumption that

I would be using that power. Now that I've seen that...
I can tell that I've been dancing on your palm

from the very beginning.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
That's right. I could have closed your door at any time

and drawn from another source of power.
But I decided not to. And it's your courage

that I chose to honor by doing so.
Whether or not you were on my palm,

that doesn't change the fact that you won.
Stand proud.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Yeah, you're right...

Yeah! Why SHOULDN'T I claim victory?
So, as promised, I'll be conducting

my interview with you now!

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Oh, uh, yes.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
So, for starters,

why did you do all this?
Oh and by ""this"" I mean the four seasons incident.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I've been feeling like it's about time

for me to release my two servants.
So I was looking for their successor.
In order to draw in candidates with

potential from a wide area...
I had the two of them draw out the latent

abilities of absolutely everybody.
The seasons simply appeared a bit strange because

of the fairies' and divine spirits' latent power.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I see. So, did you find a successor then?

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Nope, not yet.

I do have plenty of candidates, though.
I suppose this can be the last time

I use the back doors all over Gensokyo.
I'm sure my message has already been received.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
??

All right, next question.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
What, you're back?

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
We got the scolding of our lives 'cause of you!

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Begone this instant!

You filthy tengu wretch!

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Hear me!

I am known as the crow tengu of the gale, Aya Shameimaru!
I have come to challenge you to another battle

with the future of the tengu at stake!
God of impairments, Okina!

Show yourself!

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Hold on, how many questions are there?

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
As many as I need.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I'm tired after that battle.

Can we do this another time?
Oh, I know! How about I go visit

the home of all you tengu?
Now that I've seen you, I've become quite

interested in the tengu of today.
And if the tengu will accept,

why not forge a peace agreement?

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Fine, fine, that's all fine.
But you'd better promise me this:
Don't accept interviews from anyone but me!
I can't let anyone else get their

hands on a scoop this big.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
You must certainly be a bold one

to appear before me again.

","Aya","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Like I said, what's with all this season gap stuff?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Hm, she doesn't seem to be acting.
So you really are just a fairy (fool)  then.
So was your use of the gap between seasons just a coincidence?

Or perhaps...

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Chose...?
But I didn't choose anything.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Incidentally, which door did you enter from?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
From one on Larva's back.
She's a swallowtail butterfly fairy.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
A swallowtail butterfly fairy, was it?

I see...
Normally that should have been a summer door.
It's possible that she wasn't a butterfly fairy at all,

but  Tokoyo no Kami (God of the Everlasting Night)  instead.
A god who is one of my enemies.
In which case, I can't imagine this was a coincidence.
But no matter. It doesn't change the fact that

I discovered an interesting fairy.
So how about it?

Would you like to try working for me?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Work?

Why?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I've been looking for a successor for

my two servants.
All the job requires is that you dance and make a wild racket.

There's no precedent, so perhaps even a fairy would do.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
A job, huh?
I don't really wanna...
The only fairy jobs I've ever seen are ones

where someone pushes them around like a slave.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Well, think it over.
We have all the time in the world.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Oh, it's you again.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
It seemed like the master really enjoyed you.

What a surprise!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
But your forward march ends here!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Door door door...
This place...

I feel like I saw it before.
Is this that deja vu thing?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Oh, you're the one from before.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Aren't you an interesting fairy?

I'm glad you made it.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Who're you?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Whoa there.

Huh? Did you forget?
Perhaps when I helped myself

to the energy I had you gather,
you lost your memories with them?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Mmmm...

Oh yeah!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Do you remember now?

Once again, welcome.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
I just remembered that I came to this world

to get my memories back!
So, uh, who're you again?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
This isn't getting us anywhere.

Oh well, I suppose fairies (fools)  will be fairies (fools) .
It is a shame though. When I saw such ambition in a fairy last time,

I felt I had witnessed the beginning of a new era of fairies.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Hey, I'm gettin' the feeling you're making fun of me.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
It's not just your imagination.

The fool before me is nothing but a disappointment.
I'll just take the magic from the door on your back

and forcibly send you back to where you came from.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Yeah, you wanna fight?

Come at me whenever you want!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Hm? ...What is this?

The season in your back is...
It doesn't belong to any of the four seasons?
To think it would be doyou, the border between seasons

where the lifeforce of fairies is lost.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Heh heh heh.

I was nearly fooled by your idiot act.
You really are an interesting fairy.

Shall we battle once more?

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Ah! I remember now!

The person I wanted to fight again
was someone sitting in a chair!

Nothing to do with YOU! Outta the way!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I'm the one who was in the chair!

Can't you tell by looking?
But if you wanted a rematch with me,

then let's do this.
For the true power of a hidden god,

you had better savor every last drop!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
I win!

My long road to becoming the strongest is finally over!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Splendid!

Simply magnificent!
You're the first fairy to have

achieved such mastery over the door on your back.
But I do have a question

as to the way you fought.
You managed to outwit me by

drawing power from the gap between seasons,
But it seems to be that

you were not particularly aware of this.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Door on my back?

Gap between seasons? What are you even talking about?
I won, you lost!

That's it!

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
When one season transitions into another, there exists a moment

that belongs to neither spring, summer, fall, or winter.
In that moment, the power of nature weakens,

and mental energy wins out over life energy.
And for whatever reason, you chose to challenge me with

that moment--the worst possible moment for a fairy.
Whether it was a coincidence or fate, that fact prevented me

from stealing your power and forcibly ejecting you.
That's what at first surprised me,

and then intrigued me.

","Cirno","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I'll introduce ya to a girl at a shrine.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Marry who?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
You?
Are you the one responsible for this?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
I don't have time for this...
First, the little sister, and now you.
This is the worst day ever!

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
What's going on
around here?
Remilia should be at the shrine right now.
So why's everyone attacking me
this intensely?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Did someone call me?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Nope.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Sorry to keep you waiting.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Who're you?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Before you ask for a person's name...

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Oh, me?
Right, I'm Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I am Flandre,
Miss Marisa. (You could never be a shrine maiden.)

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
And what are you?
(Maybe I shoulda said nurse?)

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I've been in this house the whole time.
Even the last time you
barged in here.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
You were?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I've been sleeping in the basement.
For about 495 years.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Cool, I only get weekends off.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I heard that you often quarreled
with my elder sister.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Elder sister?
So you're her younger sister.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I wanted to see one of these
""humans"", so I tried to go outside.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Well, ain't you in luck.
Here, look as much as you like.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Will you play with me?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
What's it worth to ya?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
One coin.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
One coin?
You can't even buy a life with that.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I meant you can't
use a continue!

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Satisfied now?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
This can't be true.
I can't believe I actually lost...

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Yeah, it might be less true than you think.
I'm gonna go home for the day.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Yes, I'm satsified.
But in the end I'll be all alone again.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
?!
If you're alone, does that mean you'll hang yourself?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Why should I?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
She went and hanged herself

and then there were none.
(One hanged herself
and then there were none.)


","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Where did you hear that...?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
It's a famous nursery rhyme.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I had planned for you to be
the last one.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Right, when you went invisible
during that attack before.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
She died by the bullet

and then there were none.
(One couldn't dodge the bullets
and then there were none.)


","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Sorry to disappoint you.
Unfortunately, I'm pretty good at dodging.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Well, it doesn't matter.
I can't die, even if I hang myself.

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
A hanged corpse is pretty ugly.
Why don't you do as the real song says?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
The real song?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Wait, you don't know?
She got married
and then there were none...

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
What?
You are here again?

","Marisa","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Mai","
Oh, it's you again?

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I told you, I'm not taking the job.
Plus, it's kinda creepy how quickly you changed your tone when you lost.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
The test is over!
Get outta here! Scram!

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Hey! Anyone here?!

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
So you've returned?

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
You ran away in the middle of the final test.
I'm sad to say you've been rejected.
Now leave, immediately.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I ran away during the test...?
So that's really what happened, then?
At first I thought YOU had run away...
But when I thought it over,
it did seem pretty likely that I had run myself.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
So what business does a coward like you have with me?

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I came here for a rematch.
Not that I really care about the job or anything.
I just can't stand the thought of
keeping this loss on my record!

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
You're a human,
but you do use magic, yes?
Then you should already understand.
You should know why you were rendered helpless
and ultimately fled.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
It was because all of that back equipment.
It was used by you for both movement, and absorbing magic.
With those, you can get everything you want
without lifting a finger.
So no matter what kind of human was using it,
you could just drain all their energy.
And if you didn't need them,
you could just send them flying to wherever.

","Marisa","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
The moon's brightness.
It's too bright, isn't it?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
The moon is caused by a reflection from the sun's light.
That is the only key to the border between day and night.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
By which you mean, it's bright
because it's neither day nor night now?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Well, isn't it just because we are above the clouds?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
By the way, who are you?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
I heard about you from Ran.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
The fox boss, right?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
I didn't.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
Finally, we meet again.
Today, I have now become... 
freshly and newly possessed!

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Well, it's only been ten days.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Ahh,
What's all this commotion?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
In this evening, let's do fun banquet preparation again~

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Ooh, I see a human.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Preparations are fun?
You're a weirdo.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
What are you saying?
I mean preparation for ""fun banquet"".

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Well, I mean, some people DO.
Y'know, think that preparing is the most enjoyable part.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Anyway, have you seen a cat around these parts, by any chance?
The preparations are actually her job.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
If you're talking about Chen, then no, I haven't seen her.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Aha!  It was you, then!
You're the jerk who caused Chen trouble.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
How rude.  I don't cause anyone trouble.
I only made her something too terrible to look at.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Chen is my shikigami.
Though she's shikigami, she's not so cheap.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Shikigamis use shikigamis?
Isn't that vaguely cannibalistic?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
I don't mean I eat her.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Anyway, so what you're saying is that you, a shikigami, must have a master.
I bet it might be Chen?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
No way.
My mistress is fast asleep.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Someone who can use a ""shikigami that can use a shikigami"" is surely interesting.
Mind if I speak to this mistress of yours?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
I am also her guardian.
And as such I have no intention of letting those who make my shikigami too terrible to look at meet her.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Oh, I get it.
Now I just have to make you too terrible to look at too.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
I don't get what you think you ""get"".
Very soon, I will make you too terrible not to just look at but to do anything.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Okay, show yourself you youkai.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Gee, she's strong.
No wonder Chen had no chance against her.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Where's your mistress?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
My mistress, Yukari, is still sleeping.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
You have not yet noticed.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
This is the night of the new moon.
I hold the border between day and night in the palm of my hand.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Are you a youkai of the twilight then?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
How would it help me if I could control that...?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
or of the dawn?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
I already have you within my barriers.
As long as you're here, the dawn will never break.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
What, are you the youkai of the night-cherry blossoms then?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
The edges of my barriers cannot be found!

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Oh, the time is almost sunrise.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
And I'm really tired~

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
That wasn't that hard.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
I'm still in bad shape as I've just awakened from my hibernation.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Do you store a lot of honey before hibernation or something?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Humans.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
I see.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Supposedly Ran takes care of work.
I feel like I had an unpleasant awakening this year.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Maybe because the winter was too long?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Mamizou","
Marisa Kirisame, is it?
I'll be sure to remember that.
I intend to take my revenge, so you'd best
watch your back on the night of the full moon.

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
I'm Reimu Hakurei!

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Nue","
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected.
The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
What's that?
They called in youkai reinforcements?
Can't help getting a bad feeling about this...

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Well, now.

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Who might you be?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Are you the youkai reinforcements?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Why, indeed I am.
I am Futatsuiwa from Sado.
In any case, I received word an unruly saint
had been resurrected.
It seems she has reduced the youkai
to a trembling mass.

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Oh, was she really all that?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Hm, so you know about her?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Of course, I'm the one that revived her (huge lie)

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oho!

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
What an amusing joke.

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
What if I said I'm not joking?
(I'm joking)

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
I'd think you were enemies.
After all, are you not human?
Very well.
I shall take this as a warm-up.
And now for a ten-game match of danmaku transformations!
I wonder how many you can withstand?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
*cough*, *cough*
Pray, might I be granted a brief respite?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
You think I'll let you?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oh my!
Prithee, I'm against animal abuse!

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Well, whatever.
Aren't you supposed to be the youkai trump card?
I figured you'd be amazing, but you're just a tanuki youkai.

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oh, I hope you're not making light of tanuki.
We have quite a bit of influence in youkai society.
You might even call us elite.

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Elite?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
And in addition, my transformation power is
among the top three of Japan.

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Sure, but you're still just a tanuki, right?
The kind that drums on their bellies
on the night of the full moon, right?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
You are making light of us, are you not?
What do you call yourself?

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Hey, go after Miko, not me......

","Marisa","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Momoyo","
Keep it a secret from Iizunamaru, okay?

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Yeah!

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Woah!
Where did you come from!

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Momoyo, you fought
a splendid battle.
If even your might wasn't enough to
defeat her, I suppose we have no choice.
But I doubt Master Iizunamaru would stay silent
about it if you let her have the dragon gems.

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
I like how strong this one is.
So I'm gonna do what she wants.
You got a problem with that?

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
As long as you stay silent about it,
I'm guessin' we don't have a problem. Right, Tsukasa?

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
My, my. If Miss Momoyo is threatening me,
I suppose I'll have to oblige.
I can't possibly win, after all.

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Heh, not bad.
You smart folks really are different.

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Saki","
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice.


Unlike that foul Kicchou,

I happen to like fighting!

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
Human...... No, Marisa Kirisame.

You're courageous! I'll cooperate with you!

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Otter spirit of the Kiketsu Family!

I see you've found a good human!


But I'll have you know that I'm strong.

Hold nothing back and come at me!


Now, show this jet-black pegasus

the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
......*pant pant*


Your power, swiftness, bravery and knowledge

in facing down danmaku... All in perfect balance!


I-I'm moved!

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Oof, she's strong......

I can't let someone like this go up to the surface?

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
In consideration of your strength,

I'll pull back the invasion for now.


Even I don't want to turn it

into a war of attrition, after all.

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Thank god......

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Guess I'll have to conquer the Animal Realm

before I move on to the Human Realm, then.


The Kiketsu Family lead by Kicchou,

and the Gouyoku Alliance lead by Toutetsu...


There's also the Primate Spirit Garden controlled by Keiki,

and then there's that unidentified and despicable hidden organization......


It'll be worthwhile defeating any one of them.

Hahaha, this is getting fun.

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Hey, otter spirit~

Ain't she bad news......

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
Oh, so you felt it too?


The Keiga Family simply loves violence.

They're just a gang of thugs.


That's why their leader has nothing good to offer.

","Marisa (Otter)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit.


Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations

in order to prevent her from attacking the surface.


Please turn back now!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

I don't really know why, but I'm not scared of her anymore.


I'm sure Kicchou's

gonna do something.


But being unstoppable once we start attacking

is one of our special features.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
(......)


(Hehehe...)

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Ah ha ha!

I can't stop laughing!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki,

we can finally act freely!


Excellent work! I see pretending to be used by Kicchou paid off.

Wolf spirit!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
......Yes!

You overpraise me, Lady Kurokoma.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Wha-Wait a second!

I don't even know who you are!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
......You didn't tell the human about me, huh.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma,

boss of the Keiga Family.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
The Keiga Family......?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
(This person here's my boss.)


(The Keiga Family is an organization of animal spirits

who pride ourselves on our strong arms, swift legs and infinite courage.)


(We're the strongest group in the Animal Realm, y'know.)

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Hey, wolf spirit...

Ain't your boss kinda empty-headed?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.


It is as you've seen. We are physically strong,

but our intellect is a bit...

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
I got no idea what the politics of the Animal Realm are like......


But I can hardly imagine this family o'yours ruling it.

There's no denyin' you guys are strong, but......

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
What is it?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Keiki strikes me as the most dangerous person.

Somehow it seems like she can come at us with all her power again.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
You think so? Well if that happens, 
you'll go defeat her again for me, right?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
See, that's what I mean.

You aren't thinkin' at all, are ya?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

She's your boss? Huh.

I see.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Our brief deal with Kicchou in order to
defeat Keiki is now over.


Thanks to you defeating Keiki,

the Keiga Family, will rule all.


Soon the Animal Realm shall

come under our possession.


Perhaps not just the Animal Realm, but Hell and the Human Realm too......?

My dreams are broadening.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
I kinda get it.

I'm glad.


I won't need to hesitate

if the invader is so obvious!


You were the one who was trying

to invade the surface!


I'll beat you up right now!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Heh heh heh, that sounds nice.

Do you hear me? Wolf spirit,

you will do all you can to help this human and come at me!


It won't be fun if she's

not as strong as when she defeated Keiki.

the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

then you'll stop the invasion!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Got it, I'll back off for now.


Welp, in any case ruling over the Human Realm

will have to wait till after we conquer the Animal Realm.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Conquering the Animal Realm......

I don't have to stop that, right?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
We of the Keiga Family

were the strongest in the Animal Realm to begin with.


Since you defeated Keiki,

there's no longer anyone in our way.

"Marisa","
Hmm, but......

different from my Mini-Hakkero's.

I'm the Rainbow Dragon Cave's foreman.

I wanna ask about those dragon
gems you've been mining here.
And I'm hopin' you might be able to share some.

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Dragon gems, y'say?
Are you that thief that Tsukasa mentioned?

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

I let you off easy before,

But if you're going to cause trouble in the
tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Maan.
I might've underestimated the tengu's persistence, huh.
Are they seriously diggin' this deep?

Another one!
You thieves are just pilin' on in here, aren'tcha?

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Momoyo, I'm not a thief.
I'm Tsukasa.
This colorful ""Misumaru"" character
is the thief that I mentioned.
She's colluding with the human before you
to steal all the dragon gems from the mountain.

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Eh?
What are you talking about?
I was just thinking about
taking a tiny bit...

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

At this rate, we'll have no choice but to
close down the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
But Master Iizunamaru doesn't
know about this yet.
I shall return and report to her,
so that she may pass her judgement.

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
*Chuckle*. Hang on.
You just said that Iizunamaru doesn't
know about these two being here, yeah?

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......That is correct.

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Well, ain't this a chance to go all out?
We don't need the tengu's judgement just for
some petty thieves. I can make the call myself.
I'll pummel 'em into the dirt here and now!

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

That fox has led the conversation
in a strange direction...

Have you chosen a good card?
Well then, Marisa Kirisame, brace yourself and fight!

dragon gems with me if I win, right?

Very well!

Haah, thanks...

felt AWESOME!

","Marisa","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Yes!

all the danmaku I could ever want!

You didn't forget, right?
Our promise?

What was it, again...?

"Marisa","
That you'd share the dragon gems with me!

Out of respect for your strength,

I'll stop the invasion for now.


I'd like to avoid wasting energy too.

The human spirits in the Animal Realm are so weak

I want to know the reason behind that power.

I might just be a teensy bit

special though, you know.

Kanako said it on the way in...
I knew it!
There really is another god in this shrine.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Well, look at this!
What a surprise.
It's been a while since Kanako let a human into the inner sanctum.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Uh, well, it's more like I let myself in...
Who are you?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
I'm the real god of this shrine.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
The real one?
It looks like things are getting all muddled again...

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Outwardly it's Kanako's shrine,
but in truth it's mine.
My name isn't really mentioned publicly,
but I'm the one that does the work at the shrine.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
But, that's...
In other words, Kanako's making off with
all the fruits of your labor?

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
That's not it.
This was originally my shrine.
But it's just that a long time ago, Kanako started up a vicious war
against me and took over it.

","Marisa","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Yukari","
Ah, yes, that's why there's a shortage of humans.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Shortage of humans, hmm... is it a correct usage of the word?
...or maybe not.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
It's easy for me to manipulate the border between winter and spring...
It's your responsibility that it was taking so long to solve.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
I wasn't given responsibility to begin with.
Also, if you manipulate the border, the first spring storm will turn into north wind.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
That's right.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Or else, you could be awake while you're asleep (hibernating).

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
You mean noctambulism?
That's my hobby too.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Hobby, eh...
It's a kind of syndrome.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
No, not myself.
It's humans who get noctambulism.
With me manipulating the border between asleep and awake.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
That's really convenient.
So, by the way, isn't it supposed to be morning by now?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
It's even closer to another sunset.
Only this place is in night...

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Crap, I've got bags under my eyes with this vigil!
You tricked me!

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Yes, I hear Ran caused some annoyance to you.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
To people in the Netherworld, rather than me.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Well, in that case,
I shall continue the rage.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Another annoyance.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Ahh?
She doesn't wake up even when her shikigami is in a mess?
Wake her up.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
You say that, but she is not somewhere nearby~

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
So you're a long-distance type?
You have quite a bit of power for that type though.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
What are you talking about?
I've been in shikigami possession for quite a long time.
My power surely exceeds that of average youkai.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Okay, I understand that you're plainly worthless.
What should I do to wake her up?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
She will at night.
I only see her when she is sleeping, anyway.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
So I have to wait till nighttime...
Well, you may go back to your preparation of the fun banquet.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
...sob sob...

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
You again?
I'm tired today.
I was just about to go to sleep...

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

You really have dedication.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Strange.
Wicked strange.

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
What is strange?

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
The color of the moon this evening?
Or...

","Marisa","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Nue","
You youngster acting out of curiosity!
This unidentified flying object will make you dance to your death!

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl,
even if I've been asleep for so long......

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hey, I won.
I still don't know what's going on, but what did you do?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
We were all freed somehow at the beginning of this year.
The underground itself was, really.
When that happened, I noticed Murasa and the others
sealed away with me were up to something.
They said that if the Flying Storehouse were freed, too,
they might be able to bring back Hijiri.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hey, I got another question.
If souls don't have a particular size, then what's that thing

that's always stickin' around Youmu?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Not really. I'm just interested in souls.

I thought I could use them to make independent dolls.
Besides, that elixir wouldn't even work

on youkai, would it?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
As I am undying, phantoms are unliving.
Maybe all that's different is our form. Or guts.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Huh, I see.

So, how did my trial of guts go?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Oh, well. They're hard and blackish...

Perhaps it's liver cirrhosis?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Aw, no, have I been drinking that much?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa, to cure your guts, you should eat someone else's.

Plus, an immortal's guts are...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
A human's guts would be a bit much, immortality aside.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
An immortal's body is immune to all disease,

so my innards are totally clean.
But don't go eating them.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I'm not gonna...

Although the whole immortality thing is pretty appealing.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Well, this is a trial of guts.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
It sure is creepy when nothing's happening.

Absurd, too.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
True terror lies beyond the

fear that you expect.
There's nothing more terrifying than a haunted house

devoid of people acting as ghosts.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Even night sparrows are silent in the bamboo forest in the dead of night.

To think that there'd be humans wandering around in here.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Who're you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa, this girl...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
I'm a human who's lived here for a long time.

Don't worry. I won't kidnap you or eat you.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Human?

Doesn't look like one.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa, she definitely looks human...

but, be careful.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
So, what are you doing out this late?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Harvesting bamboo shoots.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
A trial of guts.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Which of those?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Oughta be obvious...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Beneath the full moon, a human and youkai are on a trial of guts.
Does the human have guts, or is she a fool?
That human over there ought to have guts that are

pretty stiff and tough to chew.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Are you really human?
Can't say I've seen any humans who're this fond of guts.

At least, none who're still alive.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Does she look alive to you, Marisa?
She looks dead to me.

Well, maybe she just looks like she's not alive?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Hey, don't treat people like phantoms.
That's almost correct, though.

You can see through illusions pretty well.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
So I guess yer a gut-eater, then?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Actually...
I can't die.
To be devoid of death is to be devoid of life.
Without the unnecessary states of life and death,

I'm about as close as you can get to a pure human.
So I may be like a phantom, in a certain sense.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
So she won't die!

Even if we roast or bake her, too.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
How about if we boil or fry her?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
If a human could reach a state of immortality...
That legendary medicine must really exist.

It wasn't a lie, after all.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I dunno what you're talking about.
Who the heck would tell you a true story

and make it sound like a lie?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
That medicine?

You mean the Hourai Elixir?
That old thing. I used it all up

a long, long time ago.
Certainly, I stole that medicine,

and am immortal even now.
Kaguya still tries to kill me,

but it's impossible to do that.
This stupid fight of ours has dragged on for over a thousand years now.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I get it now.

All of it.
So, you're playing the role of the ghost in this haunted house.
I did think that this whole ""trial of guts"" thing

sounded weird when Kaguya brought it up.
I defeated Kaguya, so it follows that I

could put an end to you.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Hey! You're not trying to steal all

the credit for yourself, are you?
Besides, defeating a human is a job for a youkai.

The person before us is obviously mine to defeat.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
What, Kaguya was defeated?

By these two in front of me?
How do I say this? To think that such a troublesome

Lunarian would be done in by a team like this.
It's been a long time since I've had to

confront such tough assassins.
Or maybe it's just your guts that are tough?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
It's too bad about that Hourai Elixir.

I wanted to get my hands on it no matter what.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
My guts are totally healthy. Not stiff at all.

Thus, I don't need any medicine.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
The Hourai Elixir is a forbidden medicine

that should never be consumed by humans.
With a single touch, you will never become an adult.

With a second touch, you will forget all disease and illness.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
With a third touch...

Your souls will forever churn in torment!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Aw, maaan.

That was way too tough for me...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Wanna go again?

Looks like you really can't die.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
She can't die, sure, but doesn't it look like

she's running out of stamina?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
I already have. I'd better give it a rest

before my muscle pain tomorrow keeps me from moving.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Muscle pain? That's all?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Y'know, I've always wondered. If you divide an immortal

right down the middle, which half still counts as their body?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Koishi","
Oh? You even know about my big sister?
Are you two ...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Like I said, I'm Marisa, the Great Sage.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
Why would you always wonder something like that?
Immortality is like casting away the physical body.
Your soul alone is what you actually are,

and it's able to produce a new body.
Souls don't have a particular size, so they can

create a new body wherever they like.
Conversely, a body without a soul would perish rather quickly, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
You sure know an awful lot.
It looked like you really wanted the Hourai Elixir.

Did you want to become immortal too, or something?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
It's a phantom, isn't it? Totally different thing.

Never mind that, anyway.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Geez, who started that, anyway?
Isn't it enough to have cleared the game in the first place?
If there's always an extra dungeon, then the last boss just becomes a midboss!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Don't be so blunt.
Look, according to the hell raven,)
(She got the power of nuclear fusion
from the gods of the mountain, right?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yeah, that's right. I came here to get some sort of divine blessing, too.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Um, excuse me ...
Have you seen anyone from this shrine?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Nope, I closed my third eye.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Third eye?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
The third eye, which can see through people's minds.
But that's what makes my sister weak.
I realized that mind reading made me lose to people's unconscious.
So I don't read people's minds anymore.
Uh, no, I guess I can't, really.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I don't get it, but thank goodness.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(What a shame. You could control people
easily with that kind of power.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yeah, I just beat her over there.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
You beat her?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
She came at me from over there, so it was in self-defense.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh my, it looks like no-one's here. What a shame.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What's wrong? Coming to pray for good grades?
I'll introduce you at the shrine below the mountain.
There's a shrine maiden there that never has anything to do.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I'd rather visit the shrine on the mountain.
I came here to get a divine blessing from the gods in this shrine.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(What's the divine blessing of the Moriya Shrine, anyway?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I don't know, something good, like the nuclear fusion power she gave that crow, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Nuclear fusion, crow? Are you talking about Okuu?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Who's Okuu?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(She's talking about that hell raven, Utsuho.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, it's 'cos her name is written with the kuu character for ""empty"".
That poor girl who got demoted to midboss.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
You two know about Okuu? Who are you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I'm the great magician, Marisa Kirisame. Don't forget it.
Anyway, who are you? Any pilgrim to this shrine is pretty suspicious, if you ask me.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Okuu is one of my sister's pets.
I was so jealous of her power-up.
I thought if I came here, my pets could become more powerful, too.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Are you Miss Satori's younger sister!?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What's that? Did Satori have a little sister like her?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Raiko","
My, my.
It's simple because I'm a tsukumogami.
Because when a tool's user changes,
their magic power changes, too.
Now, shall we test out
my new magical power?
Come, my drummer from the outside world!
Let your once-in-a-lifetime beat resound!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
How surprising!
I surrender?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Heh, you ain't bad at all.
Ya got some scary magic there.
But, uh,
is this magic from the outside world?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
There are lots of skilled drummers
in the outside world.
They even call them
""taiko drum masters"".

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
So the outside world has lots of
different kinds of magic, too, huh? Cool.
Anyway, I really
dug your groove.
If ya promise not to harm to humans,
I won't exterminate ya now.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Really?
I won't, I promise?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
...That was easy.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Well, I mean... I don't want to go back
to being a tool!
I was never trying to cause trouble,
I just wanted to move on my own.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Move on yer own...
I wonder if my Mini-Hakkero
wants to do that, too.
Whoops, that was a close one.
Better ditch the rest of that power now.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I have obtained the magic
to become independent.
I no longer require the powers
of the Miracle Mallet.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've finally come,
human magician.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Whew!
The magical power has finally started to wane,
but this incident was really somethin'.
I can't believe I was under the effects of my Mini-Hakkero.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Let the soul repose performance begin?!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Huh?
I thought the nue had the head of a monkey, the body of a racoon dog,
the limbs of a tiger and the tail of a snake?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh yeah, I did.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
So why would people know what I look like?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well, there's an old legend...

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I hardly ever show my true form to humans.
Because I know the most effective way of scaring humans
is to make sure they don't know what you really are.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Too bad someone does now.
Me!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
That's because you found me out by following
the Seed of Unknown Form hidden in the Flying Storehouse.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I wanted to mess with Murasa's efforts.
I thought I'd confuse them and make them fail.
But when you came into the picture,
all the pieces of the silo were assembled.
I ended up just getting you interested instead.
That's why I helped you out, too.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
You helped me out?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Well, in the end, it just ended up with you
beating me like this.
Now, human!
Boil me! Bake me alive! Do anything you wish!
Oh, but please, just don't seal me underground again.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Boil you? Bake you?
Bleh, I'm not gonna eat you.
Well, that was fun, but I guess
I should be going soon.
But, in return, will you let me have some of those
Seeds of Unknown Form or whatever?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Huh?
Well, I suppose...

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Yes! Wait, it's not a snake?
It's a glowing orb, huh?
I was sure
this seed was a snake when it was inside the UFO.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Don't worry, it's the same thing.
It's changed shapes for you now that
you know it's the Seed of Unknown Form.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh.
That's really interesting.
Maybe I'll keep the reality behind the UFOs
a secret from Reimu for now.
I think I can have some fun playing with
this Seed of Unknown Form for a while.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I was just thinking...
I'd better do something before you hurt my true form.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hm, you wanna go?
I'll ask you all about what the UFOs really are
after I beat you!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
You human who's given up imagination for knowledge!
Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I-I can't believe I lost to such an unidentifiable human!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh, looks like you were the one
who's afraid of the unknown.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Well, what are you after?
Are you going to lock me away again?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Lock you away?
Nah, not my style.
I'm more interested in these UFOs.
Apparently Byakuren didn't see them as UFOs, though.
What the heck are they,
then?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
They're fragments of the flying silo
that have the Seed of Unknown Form stuck in them.
The seed denies the object's true nature.
It's a part of me that makes the observer recognize it
as something else they've seen before instead.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What's that mean?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
When you saw an unfamiliar flying object,
you thought it was a flying saucer.
So, you just thought it was a UFO.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, really?
I really believed that UFOs were coming to Earth.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Such a mind would naturally see a UFO.
Some people see pieces of wood, some see birds or monsters.
There may even be people who saw them as danmaku.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
So why did you do that?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai
to save that monk.
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those
imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I've never heard the voice of the youkai nobody's really seen before.
A nue!
Was that weird orb of light you?

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting
would be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Storehouse.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Where'd it disappear to?
It changed into a bird, and a monster......
What was that thing riding in that UFO?
It sure feels like some youkai that isn't related
to Byakuren at all is behind this.
Huh?
What's that weird animal cry?
Sounds kind a like a monster, or a bird, or a baby.
This sound... it's...!

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Well, you yourself said it, right?
Nobody knows what I really look like.

","Marisa_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Benben","
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Let the soul repose performance begin?!

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
This is a pretty ominous storm.
This magic is on a whole different
level from the stuff before.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've finally come,
human magician.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
If you've come to seal me away,
you're already too late.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Too late?
But the Magic Mallet's power
has already run out.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Hehehe. I have obtained the magic
to become independent.
I no longer require the powers
of the Miracle Mallet.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
So what?
I already told you.
If you want to seal me, it's too late.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
I dunno what kinda magic yer using to move around,
but I'm definitely not too late for some good ol' youkai extermination!

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I wonder if you'll be able to say that
once you hear my beat.
Come, my drummer from the outside world!
Use your unknown pulse tonight to make my enemy ""beat it""!

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
How surprising!
I surrender?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
You were pretty strong.
It's kinda scary to think somethin' this
powerful could be born from a tool.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I still haven't mastered
the outside world's magic...

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
The outside world's magic, huh.
I couldn't master it either.
But anyway,
I'll let you go without exterminatin' you.
...And not because I'm after
the outside world's magic!

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Oh, really?
Then I'll just be on my way.
In the first place, we tsukumogami
aren't here to cause trouble.
Though if our user is wicked,
then we might end up making trouble...
And I don't have any memory of you using me, so...

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
So if your user is wicked,
then you will make trouble...

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
What's wrong?
Did you remember something?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Ah, no.
Nothin' like that...
Man, I really need be careful with that Mini-Hakkero.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
What?
So yer movin' usin' a different magic?
I see. In that case,
there's no way I can just leave ya be.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Is that so?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
I learned somethin' important from my
Mini-Hakkero before.
When tools move on their own, it's a huge pain!
So the simple fact that yer moving
on yer own makes ya a nuisance!

","Marisa_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
You must've done something bad.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I've... been locked away underground
for a long, long time.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
She's already back now.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, I think it'll be fine if you just go meet her.
They're pretty close to the human village.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
No, I can't go see them.
If I meet Murasa, they'll find out I'm the one that was
causing them trouble. Besides,
My real body is hurt now.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh. Well, anyway, I think I've got
some rumors to go spread now.
All about the true form of the nue.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I wasn't part of their group, so I felt like
I just couldn't let them have their fun.
So, I scattered the Flying Storehouse's fragments above ground.
I made them into unidentified flying objects.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
And that's what looked like UFOs.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Well, that's enough talk.
Are you going to seal me away, too?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Seal you?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
A long time ago, when a human discovered my true form,
they immediately captured me and sealed me away underground.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, I don't wanna do anything like that.
I guess there's people who love sealing stuff up, though.
I don't know why you don't seem to get along with
any of Byakuren's crowd, though.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Hmm?
Oh, no, Murasa and them were good company.
I just wish they would admit they're siding with the humans.
That gets on my nerves.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Siding with humans?
You mean, because they're siding with Byakuren?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I thought I'd give in, though, since Murasa and
the others were shut in underground for a long time, too.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong idea.
See, that Byakuren monk
is a total sham.
She fought humans, and even said that youkai need
saving more than humans do.
And on top of all that, they put up a temple
specifically for use by youkai.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
What?
That monk is? Are you sure?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
It wouldn't be a surprise for them to be
interested in helping a youkai like you.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
What's that...?
I can't believe I caused trouble for a human like that.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Where did it disappear to?
Maybe it was hopeless trying to chase something that small.
Well, there's a lot of UFOs around here.
I guess I can always break open some more.
Huh?
What's that weird sound......
A bird... no, some kind of monster?
What is it?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting would
be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Storehouse.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
You... you showed up in the ship, and in Makai.
Hm, a flying youkai of unknown nature...
Do I know of any youkai like that?
I guess that'd make you something like a nue?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai
to save that monk,
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those
imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, ohhh?
You're really a nue?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
You're an interesting human.
You're not afraid of things you don't understand?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Afraid?
I'd be excited to find something
I didn't know anything about.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Hmm.
It must be nice to be young.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hehe, I guess.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
This must be an unintended consequence of my
scattering the Seed of Unknown Form around.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Seed of Unknown Form?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I thought I'd scatter the fragments of the Flying Storehouse
around and use them to scare you humans, but...

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, the UFO?
Is that what you meant by that seed?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Aahhn...

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
The only people who thought it looked like a UFO
was a few of you humans.
It was just something flying through the sky,
something you didn't recognize.
Each person sees it differently
depending on their experience and knowledge.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh.
I don't really get it, but...

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
So, why did you come looking for me?
Why were you chasing after the UFO?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, just curiosity.
Curiosity about the unknown.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Then what will happen to my reason to live?

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I'm the nue, the youkai of indeterminate form.
Being unknown is the source of my power.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hm, you wanna go?
I don't get what's going on, but I don't wanna lose to someone nue-like.

","Marisa_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Koishi","
Hm, if you want to turn me away, just try to beat me.
Don't get confident just because you beat my sister, though.
We'll decorate the entrance of the Palace of the Earth Spirits with your corpse!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Who's your sister, anyway?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Wow, you're really strong! I can see how my sister lost to you.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Come play at my house next time.
We'll find some interesting spirits for you, or something.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hmm. I don't mind going...
But it could be pretty hard getting there.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh, don't worry. If you just tell people you're friends with the people at the Palace,
I'm sure most of the youkai will avoid you.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(... wow, everybody hates them.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
My sister is bad at fighting, but everybody is afraid of her.
Just say her name, and you'll have free run of the underground.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hm, so does that mean I can go anywhere I want down there?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Well, I, uh...)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, yeah.
There's someone else who doesn't like you too much.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Who's that?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Whatever, I'll be fine. If you want to go
back underground, you can go by yourself.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
By yourself, what? Aren't you... Do you have multiple personalities?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Nope, from now on I'm just the one personality.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, is your sister...?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you the one who visited the Palace?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I knew it, you're that Satori girl's sister...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Yeah, I thought this would be a waste since the gods aren't in,
but it looks like I found something worthwhile after all.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(So what did you come here for?)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Well, I heard that the god who gave Okuu nuclear fusion power lived on a mountain.
I was wondering if I could get some powers for my pets, too.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(That's too bad. These gods probably won't do anything
that won't benefit them.)
(The only reason your house's pet got nuclear fusion power
is because it helped their plans.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
What, really? That's boring...
Oh well, I got to meet someone interesting.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I'm pretty interesting.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
It sure is cold on the mountain.
I guess it's winter, after all.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(The rivers freeze over in the winter. It makes life easy for us.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The rivers freezing makes it easy on you? Why's that?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(It's actually warm underneath the ice.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Anyhow can I interrupt?
Why are you talking to me like this when I'm on the mountain?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(I guess it's become a habit.
Besides, I don't wanna leave the water.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh well, whatever.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Don't.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I couldn't.
It was raining too hard.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
You've got special needs, it seems.
Did you do something bad in the past?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I couldn't have done anything.
I haven't gone out even once
in the past 495 years.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
A real problem child.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I have a play toy over here...

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
What do you want to play?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
The danmaku game.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Oh, the pattern-making game.
I'm pretty good at that.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
See?
This is the power of those who serve gods!

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Don't go thinking you won with that.
There's still more to come!

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
!?
Er, you're in really bad shape though.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Yes, I can't even shoot smoke anymore...

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I'll come play whenever you want.
So please, don't come to the shrine.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Oh, and I was thinking of visiting you
with cake and tea, as thanks.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Try not to bring your kind
of food to a human's place.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
It's not too sweet, is it?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Not even if it's sugar-free!
Be a good girl. Go back home
and go to sleep.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
...But this is my house.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
So you don't need to go home.
Fitting for a bad girl.
I'm going home now.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Bad girls don't need to go home.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
...I left another bad girl
at the shrine, after all.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Who do you mean, bad girl?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I'm here again.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Mai","
Oh, it's you again?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
While we're at it, why don't I join you for some
drinks and a flower-viewing at the shrine?
Ah, we've got so much fun to look forward to...

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Which means you're not qualified to be here!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Come on out already!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Why, to think that you'd
come back here...

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
How very brave of you.
You have my respect.
However, you should understand by now
that victory against me is impossible.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Well, yeah, 'cause you got up and ran off
in the middle of our battle.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
What?
It seems that you're misremembering things.
You're the one who ran.
I helped myself to the magic power
that I had led you to collect...
Which rendered you helpless in the
end, so you fled. Didn't you?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
I fled?
That's ridiculous. There's no way.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
You really don't remember...
Well, I happen to remember it just fine.
With all your weapons sealed off,
you escaped through your own door and returned home.
Through the very same season door you have right now.
Do you want to meet the same fate again?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
The season door...
So that was it, after all.
I don't remember fleeing, but there was a moment
when I thought ""wait, hang on a second...?""
Because before I even knew it, I'd been returned
to the location of the season I'd collected.
In other words, the door on my back was a trap
that both absorbs magic power and forcibly ejects people!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Indeed. You did well to figure it out.
That's why you have no chance of victory.
No matter what, you'll be chased out of here in the end.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Heh heh heh.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Hm? What's the matter?
Do you have a screw loose?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
My theory was correct!
Victory is mine!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
What's this, now?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Take a look at my back.
This time, I've been gathering
the boundary between seasons!
That means there's no location in
existence for me to get ejected to!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Oho... I see that the door on your back right now...
Corresponds to doyou, the border between seasons
where the world loses its vitality entirely.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Hm hm hm.
Not a bad strategy.
However, this also means that you've
cut off your own escape route.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
That just means I won't budge an inch
until I beat you for good, this time!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Hah hah! I like you!
You're the Hakurei shrine maiden,
so I can't make you my subordinate,
but as a show of respect for your intelligence...
I'll fight you without using the
seasonal magic that I've gathered.
See it! Hear it! Speak of it!
The secret god's true magic power shall be your greatest impairment!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Did I beat her?!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I've been beatennn!
Only natural for the Hakurei maiden, of course.
To think that you'd evade all of my attacks...!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Okay, now I've won for real.
So give up on all your evil schemes right now!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Mmm~mm, what am I gonna do now~?
I still haven't found successors
for my servants or anythi~ing...
And without their successors, I can't release
those two girls any time soon. Poor thi~ings...

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Try hiring people in a way that doesn't
make a huge mess of the seasons.
Like flyers. Or interviews, or something...

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Me, a secret god? Do that?
I don't wann~a.
But eh, it's fine.
Guess I'll just have those two keep working at it for a while.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Why do youkai insist on making such
a big show of everything, anyway?
You always get way too chummy
with me as soon as you lose, too.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I'm not a youkai, I'm a god!
By the way...
About that whole ""use the border between
seasons as your backdoor"" technique...
You didn't come up with that by yourself, did you?
A method that uses borders like that... it reminds me a lot
of a certain someone I'm rather familar with.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
...Well, who knows.
Honestly, I don't really understand the logic behind it either?
Like, what's with all of this? Doors on people's backs,
seasonal weaponry, berserk life force, blah blah blah...
Trying to understand all this ridiculous
youkai theory is just impossible, if you ask me!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Not youkai, though! A god!
Really, it's only natural that all of this
would exceed human understanding.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Yes, okay. Sure.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
From where I'm standing, though,
I'd say you seem more like one of ""our side"" too.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Yeah, whatever.
I'm gonna head back soon.
...Uh, which door should I go through to get back home?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
If you want the Hakurei Shrine, I'd recommend the
door 2nd from the bottom and 40th from the right.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Thanks.
Now, you'd better return the seasons to normal, okay?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Hecatia","
Aw, geeze.
You totally kept me waiting, y'know.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
G-goddess?
You?

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
So we're finally gonna get revenge on Chang'e, huh?
My fingers are so itching?

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Ah, no. Your enemy is the human
before you, not the moon's people.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Okina","
...I see.
She's hinting to me that she knows what I'm up to...?
Pretending that I was searching for successor servants
and making a big show of things seems to have paid off, in the end.
It seems that the Gensokyo we all created
is still functioning just fine.
Honestly, it seems to be functioning too well,
to the point where nobody can fully control it...
But that, too, is what the sages wanted for it.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Um...
You said 40th from the right,
but did you mean my right, or yours?
Even up and down are kind of sketchy in here.

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Oh, sorry about that.
By now, the 16th door from my left
would be your best bet...
How about I come with you, just to be safe?

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Yes, please...

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
We heard that you didn't make the cut.
Can't say I saw that one coming!

","Reimu","Extra","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Hecatia","
Sorry, sorry. I was just playing around a bit.
I lost the battle.
Honestly, attacking Gensokyo?
When there's such amazing humans there?
I've got no idea what the moon's people were thinking.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Let the people of the moon go. Now.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Hey, Junko.
Is this okay?

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
...it's fine.
Even if they return to the capital...
Thanks to my encounter with this human,
I've lost my will to fight.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Sure thing, sure thing.
Releasing the moon's people now.
They ought to pull out
of Gensokyo now, too.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
...y'know, I'm still not satisfied with
ending up saving the moon's people...

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Well, about that...

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
The people of the moon truly are cunning and cruel.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Hm?

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
You can think of it
as them taking Gensokyo hostage, no?
""If you want Gensokyo to be spared,
leave the moon."" A terribly inhumane strategy.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Huh, guess so.
When I think about it like that,
I get somehow annoyed.
Next time I meet Eirin's lot,
I'm gonna have to punch them.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Eirin?
Is that the name of the lunar sage living on Earth?

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Er, um, uhhhhh,

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Could you perhaps guide me
to her place of residence?

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Uh, um.
Is that okay? Having you meet her?

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
I don't particularly intend to fight her.
For now.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Sounds good! Take me along, too!
It's thanks to this sage that I
met a human like you, after all.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Well, all right.
But you'd better remember this, okay?
If you cause any sort of problem in Gensokyo,
I'll exterminate you at once!

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Yes, yes.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
So you've come here again, hm...
Have you prepared yourself?
Your lunatic dream isn't over yet.
Know a reality that will follow you forever!

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
It took longer than I anticipated
for them arrive at this answer.
Since they came up with the scheme to use a human,
I thought they'd realize it right away...

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Bah, it's you again!
I knew this had to be your doing!

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were
unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin
into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself!
Hecatia, goddess of hell!

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Nitori","
(If you want a share of our nuclear energy,
stop complaining.)
(We tamed the crow in charge of it, so now we just
have to go tell the god of the mountain.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Um, excuse me?
Have you seen anyone from this shrine?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Nope.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(You liar, we just saw someone.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, yeah, just a minute ago.
We beat her, though.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
You beat her? Why?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
It was her way of greeting us, or something like that.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Hmm. It looks like the gods aren't here today.
Let's come back later.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
What? The gods aren't here?
Oh, no. And I came all the way up here from deep underground...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What? Did you say from deep underground?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
What a waste of time to come while the gods are out... What could I possibly gain from this?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Ah, you gained tiredness.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Huh? I'm not tired yet.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Marisa, she might want to get her hands on
fusion energy, too.)
(Be careful.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Fusion energy? How do you know about fusion energy?
But man, those mountain gods have a pretty nice shrine, don't they?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
You... are you after fusion energy, too!?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(We're not gonna hand it over!
Take her down, Marisa!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, calm down.
Maybe she's just a normal shrine visitor.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hmm, you're the human that came to the underground, aren't you?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
If you wanted to beat me like you did Sis and Okuu, by all means.
Since I went to the trouble of coming up from the underground, I'd like to get something out of it.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Yes!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Are you Satori's younger sister?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Hm, they're still not back?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, it's Sanae.
What were you off doing?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
We just saw each other a few minutes ago!
Anyway, what are you here for? Lady Kanako and Lady Suwako are both out.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hmmm, let's see...
Hey, Patchouli, we wanted to ask the gods something, right?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Satori's little sister... um, let's see,
don't I have any documents on her somewhere?)
(Huh? Something to ask the gods?
Yes, about nuclear fusion, remember?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Nuclear fusion...? Yes, our plan is going along quite nicely.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(In any case, if what that hell raven said
was true,)
(Then she got the power to control nuclear fusion
from the gods of this mountain.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Um, excuse me...?
Have you seen anyone from this shrine?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, uh...?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(I don't know, I was reading a book.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh, I guess not, then. Sorry, but I don't know too much about this shrine.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh, I see, sorry to have bothered you.
Maybe they're out now...

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Did you try visiting the main building?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Yes.
It was just an empty shell.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What do I do now, Patchouli?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Hmm, there's nothing you can do if they're not here.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Are you looking for the gods of the mountain, too?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yeah, kind of.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Did you come to this shrine looking for power, too?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Power?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I heard you can get the ultimate power if you meet the gods of the mountain.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Really, now?
Who's been spreading that rumor?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I heard it from one of my sister's pets.
The gods of the mountain made Okuu really strong.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Okuu? Sister? I've got a bad feeling about this.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(... a bad feeling...
Marisa.)
(I'm going to take a bit of an afternoon nap.
Good luck!)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, hey!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Do you want the mountain gods' power, too?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, that's not what I came for, but I wouldn't mind it.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Then that makes us rivals.
My sister is always saying that you can't make your dreams come true if you can't beat all your rivals.
I don't have anything against you, but I hope you're ready to die a dog's death.
Oh, don't worry, that cat will carry off your body, so you'll be able to live in our place!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Wooow... you're really strong? I see I was wrong to think you're just some normal human.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
It sure is cold on the mountain.
I guess it's winter, after all.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Ah, it's so wonderful to spend the afternoon

sipping warm tea in a warm house.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, you looking for a fight?
Why do you have to do this while I'm above ground, anyway?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Mountains in winter are dangerous for novices.
It's best not to recklessly decide to climb them.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The Remains of Blazing Hell was way more dangerous than this.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Oh, didn't you hear? We're going to create a kappa industrial revolution by using the old Remains of Blazing Hell.
If it works, our standard of living will be much better.
Nuclear fusion energy is a clean energy that even the outside world hasn't mastered yet.
It's exciting to think that I'll see the power of the sun harnessed here on the Earth.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I don't understand what you're saying at all.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(So, nuclear fusion is the key to revolutionizing
the kappa's industry?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Anyway, it's not dangerous, right?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Of course not. I guess Lady Kanako didn't explain this to you, did she?
It might cause geysers, which might make hot springs appear, though.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(So, in the end, this whole incident was just a misunderstanding
caused by the gods of the mountain not explaining things?)
(I'm tired...
I'm going to bed.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Well, I'm going home, but come play with me some time? You promised?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, this is nice. Now I have an excuse to go see the underground as much as I want.
Okay, let's do it!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
But I am human.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
No way! I can't believe a human could be so strong... oh,
Are you the person that came to play in the Palace of the Earth Spirits?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Palace of the Earth Spirits? Hm, I think I've been there before.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Really? There can't be that many people as strong as you.
I'm Koishi Komeiji.
I live in the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(What did she say...? I thought she was
just a normal human shrine visitor at first.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh, your intuition's not that great.
It's obvious she's a youkai to me.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(... you don't feel like a
youkai to me.)
(Actually... I can't sense anything
at all from you.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
That's because I deal with the unconsciousness.
Since I closed off my ability to read minds, I gained the ability to move around free of thought.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(A state of mu...
If a Buddhist priest heard of her, he'd cry tears of joy.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
But, I won, anyhow.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
You're really strong.
Do you want to come play at my house?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, I don't have anything better to do, but it's so far away.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Hmm, I hadn't heard that
she had a younger sister.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
What?
You are here again?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
You and your sister!!

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
My asthma isn't bad today,
so I'll show you
my best magic!

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Today is unusually hot.
Are they attacking more violently
because of that girl
who went crazy before?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
How naive!
You there, red-white!

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
There's another crazy one?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Who are you? I don't think you were here when I came
last time...

"Flandre","
I was, but you couldn't see me.
So, are you a human?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Yes, that's right.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
You're not trying to trick me, are you?
I've only ever seen humans
in the form of a drink.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Yes, I'm actually human.
Humans are a bit more complicated than black tea.
Most of them are, anyway.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
But, chickens...

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
...even if you don't know how to cook them,
they're still tasty.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
And who makes food out of humans
in your household?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I dunno? I don't think
my sister does...

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Sister?
Replica-somethingorother, the devil?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
Remilia!
My sister Remilia.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I doubt that your sister
can cook at all.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
She doesn't.

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
There's something I want to tell you.
Your older sister keeps intruding on my shrine
and being a nuisance.
Could you do something about it?

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Flandre","
I know.
I wanted to go too...

","Reimu","Extra","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sanae","
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Woah, it's cold up on the mountain.
The hot springs appeared and the spirits went away, isn't that enough work for now?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Look, it's the extra dungeon for after you beat the game.
Good luck!)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
It's not that great.
The conscious always loses to the unconscious.
People don't just act on what they consciously think.
They act on both the conscious and the unconscious.
If you read their mind, you can't tell what's going on in their unconscious mind.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hmm, I see.
Well, I got all warmed up, but I couldn't find Kanako or anyone else.
Guess I'd better be heading home.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(What?
Don't tell me you're done here?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, Reimu will take care of seeing if there's anything between the underground and the mountain gods.
I'll just ask her later.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(You're so easygoing.
Maybe I should look into it myself, later?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Besides, I figured out something really important.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(...?
What?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The shrine's totally empty now.
It's the perfect time to go fishing.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh my, thieving is bad, you know?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"??","
""Later, Kanako caught Marisa
going through their house.""
""She got put through the wringer.
The End.""

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Are you the doll-using thief that they said visited our house?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Wha-

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Tee hee.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I'm Koishi Komeiji.
I couldn't find the gods of the mountain, but it looks like I found a good playmate.
Stealing is bad, okay? Miss Above Ground Human.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, whatever. I did beat Kanako and Suwako, though.
It looks like they're not around, so I'll play with you.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I heard about you from my sister and Okuu.
That thief dodged danmaku just like bits of paper dancing in the air.
She said you were psychologically unsettling, like a flea crawling up your back.
If I beat you and take you back home, I'll definitely become the talk of the house!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
You're stroooong! I can see how you beat my sister.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yep, I crushed you easily!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Was it really that easy?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Thanks for spending time with me!
I couldn't take you alive, but this will probably be worth some talk back home.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Uh, oh yeah, you're Satori's little sister ...
So, uh, can you read minds, too?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Your sister?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Sis mentioned a weird human with orbs that disturbed our home.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Hey, Marisa
What are you doing? Hurry up and get her out of here)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Y...yeah
I won't hand over the power of fusion to you. Get out of here.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Mamizou","
Vast is the sea.
Hundreds of times the size of Gensokyo.
There's no use in thinking yourself strong
if you know so little of the world.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Why?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oh my, can it be
that you know not of the sea?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Tsukasa","
I let you off easy before,
since you seemed useful......
But if you're going to cause trouble in the
tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
I can't see the end
no  matter how much I go on...
Are they trying to fill the mountain with holes?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You're... not Tsukasa.
Who are ya!?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
I am the Hakurei shrine maiden,
Reimu Hakurei!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
The Hakurei shrine maiden!?
Ahh, yep. That's her dumb face, all right.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Heh-heh-heh. Beg your pardon.
The name's Momoyo.
I'm the Rainbow Dragon Cave's foreman.
So, what brings the Hakurei shrine maiden to see me?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
You're the foreman?
I totally thought that Misumaru person was in charge.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
""Misumaru""?
Who's that?
*Gasp*, are they that thief
Tsukasa mentioned?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Ironic that you would call me a thief.
Isn't your band of youkai,
led by an oomukade...
The ones who are digging up the Youkai Mountain
and stealing the Izanagi Objects?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Another one of ya!? Who are you!?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
I am Misumaru Tamatsukuri,
the rightful owner of the dragon gems.
Your actions have been wholly unacceptable.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
No thank you.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Oh, I see. So she really wasn't
some friend of yours...?
Well, whatever. If I ever find her,
we'll just have another fight like today!
When that time comes,
we can fight her together!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
By the way, who was that
Misumaru lady, after all?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Hahaha!
You're definitely one of my favorites!
Let me introduce you to Iizunamaru!
She's a total combat-lover,
just like you.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
......Ah!
I hadn't thought of that.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Again with those jokes!
If you just came to investigate,
then you could've just run away
when I began attacking!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
...Mmmm.
I'm here to investigate these mines.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
You're not a thief?
......
Then why'd you come all the way down here?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Like I said, I'm not a thief!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Give the jokes a rest!
Someone who hates fighting wouldn't have been
moving nearly as fiercely as you were just now.
You might be a thief, but I'll always
give a warm welcome to tough customers!
Come and steal your fill whenever you please,
at the Rainbow Dragon Cave!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Ugh, I really got put through the wringer...
Why did I end up having to fight you, anyway?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
...That...
felt AWESOME!
Thanks for letting me shoot all
the danmaku I could ever want!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
I've been looking for someone who I'm allowed
to fight without holding anything back!
Tremble in joy!
The mountain shall be your grave!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
I'm not a thief, but I guess I just
have to roll with it at this point.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Are you finished getting ready?
You cowardly thief!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Wai--
Why am I getting roped into this!?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Have you chosen a good card?
Well then, Reimu Hakurei, brace yourself and fight!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
How unfortunate. We're about to get into a
pointless fight, thanks to that fox's prodding.
Your opponent is an oomukade,
a disgusting youkai that eats even dragons.
You must win against her.
Let me lend you a bit of strength.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Well, ain't this a chance to go all out?
We don't need the tengu's judgement just for
some petty thieves. I can make the call myself.
I'll pummel 'em into the dirt here and now!

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Whazzat?
Rightful owner?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
*Chuckle*. Hang on.
You just said that Iizunamaru doesn't
know about these two being here, yeah?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
At this rate, we'll have no choice but to
close down the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
But Master Iizunamaru doesn't
know about this yet.
I shall return and report to her,
so that she may pass her judgement.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Eh?
Hang on, what are you saying?
I just came to investigate the cards...

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Momoyo, I'm not a thief.
I'm Tsukasa.
This colorful ""Misumaru"" character
is the thief that I mentioned.
She's colluding with the human before you
to steal all the dragon gems from the mountain.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Another one!
You thieves are just pilin' on in here, aren'tcha?

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......That is correct.

","Reimu","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Kutaka","
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit.


Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations,

in order to prevent her from attacking the surface.


Please turn back now!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
So true invaders from

the Animal Realm showed up!


Since I gave them the opportunity by returning to the surface,

guess I'll have to take them down too!

I have a bad feeling about this......

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

The Animal Realm's just too small for me.


Well, I'll be thanking you in advance.

It'll be a bother.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Well, whatever.
What I've just seen of the

strength of humans is very satisfying.
I've decided!

I'll go to the Human Realm next!

(Ehh? I thought you

were already a part of us~.)

joining any animal spirit organizations. Got it?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
A human may not know this,

but the leader of the Gouyoku Alliance, Toutetsu, is the worst.


If a greedy bastard is at the top of the organization,

the underlings would never be happy.


When it comes to that, we of the Keiga Family are better.

You can climb up the ladder quick, as long as you're strong.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Hm?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
How about it? Won't you consider

abandoning the eagle spirit and joining the Keiga Family?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Is that so......

I'm completely worn out.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Your power, swiftness, bravery and knowledge

in facing down danmaku... All in perfect balance!


I-I'm moved!

"Saki","
Eagle spirit of the Gouyoku Alliance!

I see you've found a good human!


But I'll have you know that I'm strong.

Hold nothing back and come at me!


Now, show this jet-black pegasus

the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Eagle)","
Human...... I'll lend you my power!

Let's stop this violent leader's rampage together!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Heh heh heh, that sounds nice.


Unlike that foul Kicchou,

I happen to like fighting!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
It'll be fine, eagle spirit.

I won't allow the invasion to happen.


Roping me into the Animal Realm's conflict

was a mistake!


I'll beat you right here,

and put an end to your beastly ambitions!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Eagle)","
Don't be ridiculous.

You'll never manage that!


No, wait, she's the head of the Keiga Family.

If anyone can do it, it's those violent brutes!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
The one possessing you

is an eagle spirit from Toutetsu's gang, right?


To think the prideful Gouyoku Alliance would

cooperate with Kiketsu Family! How unexpected.


Thanks to you defeating Keiki,

the Animal Realm has returned to being a competitive society.


And thus, the strongest, fastest army,

the Keiga Family, will rule all.


Soon the Animal Realm shall

come under our possession.


Perhaps not just the Animal Realm, but Hell and the Human Realm too......?

My dreams are broadening.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

This person is the sworn enemy of the Gouyoku Alliance.


She's the leader of a gang of thugs

who have nothing worth boasting about.

The Keiga Family......?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

but the moon's people can't return to the capital...

You sure found some good material,
Junko.

But thanks to them, my once-dismal life on Earth
may get a lot more fun.

Or should I call in my other two selves and make it four on one?

No... that would be quite a waste indeed.
Let's do this fairly and battle in turns.

tied down in the dream world.
They're totally defenseless while
they're in here. It was easy.

","Reimu","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

into the dust right here!

All right. You're a cute little thing,
so I'll play with you a bit.

the likes of a human, but...
""You used some rude language towards me.""

Isn't this shrine Kanako's?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
A long time ago, I got beaten by Kanako, so now it's her shrine. Can't help that.
But you know what, I'm free to stay around the shrine, and people's faith in me has risen.
It's not like I'm not grateful, I guess...
Anyway, what is it? You're the shrine maiden from down below the mountain, right?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Geez!  You're a shrine maiden, so you should know this!
""Omatsuri"" are another way of saying ""kami asobi"", which means it's a time when gods play with humans!

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Don't tell me, those battles with Sanae and Kanako were...

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Yep, just a little god play, or festivals.
Today it's my turn to have a danmaku festival!

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Ahahahaha. Simply admirable for a human to defeat a god who's built up a country by herself.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
What was all that about a festival? Isn't this just normal danmaku play?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
Like I said, festivals are a time for gods to play.
They're special days where you leave all your everyday cares behind!

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Hmmm, but danmaku is an everyday thing...

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
If the humans that live here are this strong, maybe it's not so bad to live in Gensokyo.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Oh my, I wonder if I overdid it?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
I've already decided to stay here.
Oh yes, wouldn't it be great if we start having festivals at your shrine?
If we did that, I bet a lot of people would come.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"

A danmaku festival? I wonder if anyone would really come.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
If they would, Sunday would be nice to have an annual grand festival.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I suppose...
I know a little more about the secrets of this shrine now, so I'm going home for today, okay?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
If you don't get more visitors, or if Kanako does anything strange...
Come see me about it, okay?

Okay, okay.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
After all, Kanako's faith and divine virtues are mostly thanks to me.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
What did you just...?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
I provide the divine services. I guess you could say that Kanako does the sales.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
The world of the gods is a tough place, isn't it...?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Well, ah, I came to find out the secrets of this shrine.
It looks like you're on pretty good terms with those two, so I think I'll be going back now.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Suwako","
What are you saying?  You got to play with Sanae and Kanako, right?
Do you think you'd be fit to be a shrine maiden if you ignored only me?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Well, yes.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Kanako","
Oh, do you mean to go further ahead?
You may not ? there rests my ever-sleeping friend.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
If she's Kanako's friend...
That must mean she's another god.

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Who said we're friends?
She selfishly sent my shrine into Gensokyo...
Then she shamelessly said, ""Oh! Don't worry, it'll be okay"".
That kind of woman is an enemy. An enemy!

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Used to?

","Reimu","Extra","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Yukari","
Either way, I'm here now and I'm awake.
That is proof enough that I have the will to work.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
""Willing to work"" and ""getting work done"" are entirely different!

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Compared to a shrine maiden who's rarely in her shrine, I think I'm getting plenty of work done.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Exorcism is my job.
I should receive hazard pay for my work.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Oh, it's almost dawn.
I have to return home and sleep...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
Finally, we meet again.
Today, I have now become...
freshly and newly possessed!

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Which part of you is new, then?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
If I'd traveled all the way to the land of the dead
only to find what I was looking for wasn't there...
That would totally suck.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Oh?  This is rare.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
They have people like this here too.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
What do you mean ""like this""?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Like you. 
Happy sorts clothed in red and white.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
First a cat, and now a fox... 
When did this place become the Animal Realm?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Ah, so you're the human who gave Chen a hard time?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
What if I am?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Chen is my shikigami.
She has recovered, and grown stronger than before.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
... She was supposed to be strong?
Wait, she's your shikigami? 
Aren't you a shikigami yourself?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Indeed I am.
My master is still asleep right now.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
So all in all, you did exactly nothing.
Where on Earth do you live?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
The same place as you.
At the edge of Gensokyo.
Along the north-eastern edge.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
That's a very ominous direction.
Don't you dare tear a hole in the barrier.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Oh, didn't I say that I already had, before we fought?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Go home and sleep!

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Ah.  So you're the one I'm looking for, then.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
For what?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Repairing the border between the Netherworld and our world...
And...
Come to think of it
For that to happen... 
I've got to talk to your master.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
My master is hibernating.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Wake her up.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
I am also her guardian.
I have no intention of allowing 
troublemakers to meet with my master.
Now, you will meet your end at 
the hands of a strengthened Chen...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
If you mean that cat, I met her just now...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
You did?
How did that go?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
It was nothing special.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Well... but she was still recovering...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Didn't you just say that she'd already recovered?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
...Looks like I have to take revenge for her now.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Just as I expected.
Defeat a shikigami, and maybe its master will wake up...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
In spring, my master sleeps a sleep that knows no dawn.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Well, in the meantime, there's a more immediate obstacle around.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
I am many orders of magnitude different from Chen.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Did you think that a shikigami could stand up to a shrine maiden?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
How could my formulas have failed?
You cheated, didn't you?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
What?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
I thought for sure that you were only human.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
I am human.
Anyway, for all my trouble, 
you will introduce me to your master.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
My master, Yukari, is still sleeping...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
""Still"", you say. When will she awaken?
Spring has already arrived in full.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
She sleeps through winter and all day.
It's still too early for her to wake up.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
I think it's already pretty close to dusk...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
For us it isn't.
When humans go to sleep, that's what we consider the true night.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Whatever, wake her up now.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
But she isn't here~

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
So, I shot you down for nothing?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
And I was shot down for nothing?
So what are you here for anyway?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Well, let's see.
Disturbance in the Netherworld, someone's errant shikigami...
Oh yeah, I'm here to punish you.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Awww...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
You again?
I'm tired today.
I was just about to go to sleep...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
As promised, I have come at night.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
It's high time for the truth to emerge.
The night only gets so dark.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Shall I emerge, then?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Look, I'm here now.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Oh, perfect timing.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
You are the human who defeated my Ran?
Knowing that dangerous humans like you exist keeps me from sleeping soundly.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Even so, you sure took your time getting up.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Well... I'm awake now.
And you...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Yeah?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
You are the happy person from Hakurei Shrine, are you not?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Basically yes, while I'm not quite sure what you mean by ""happy.""

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
The Hakurei Barrier is weakening along the north-east.
If left alone, it might wear out completely.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Oh, that's dangerous. 
Thanks for letting me know.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
No, no, you see, I'm the one trying to tear a hole in it.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Well then, go fix it!

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
After all, youkai are youkai...
Beating them down and cleaning up afterwards 
has to be done by a human.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Oh, haven't you noticed?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Here, in Hakugyokurou where we stand,
the border between youkai and humans wears thin.
You came this far, and were able to cross over from the human side.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Well then, go fix it now.
It was my intention to make you fix it from the start. 
And since you'll be doing that anyway...
Having to fix an extra barrier or two 
won't make much of a difference, right?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
An extra barrier or two...
Do you think that there are that few?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Now then, as you promised, get to work.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
I was going to do so even without your demands...

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Liar.
How much time went to waste while you were lazing off?

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
That's because I was asleep.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Obviously.

","Reimu","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
No, well, I saw it once.
On the moon.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Well, now! Just once?
What a shame that is.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
The sea?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Hmm, perhaps that is true.
Then it, cannot be helped.
Still, what a shame that my long journey
across the sea from Sado is for naught.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Besides, doing any more
won't let you beat me.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
One, two, three......
Oh, indeed I have.
I'd thought we were only at seven or eight.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Haven't you already done ten transformations?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
*cough*, *cough*
Pray, might I be granted a brief respite?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Now that I've arrived, though,
I'll have to put you back in your place.
My transformative powers are still at their prime.
Now, shall we begin a ten-game match 
of danmaku transformations?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oh, ho, ho.
My, but you sound confident.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Oh, but I beat her.
She was a piece of cake!

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Er, however, I'd heard something about
 a sealed saint having been released?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Well, I guess that's because I'm exterminating them all.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Nue called me here, you see.
She said the youkai were in a pinch,
and she wanted me to lend my assistance.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Mamizou?
What an odd name.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oh, your pardon, please.
I am Futatsuiwa from Sado.
Everyone calls me Mamizou.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Who're you?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Aren't you the miko of Hakurei?

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Well, now.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
I've got a bad feeling about this......
It smells like youkai around here.
Or, like wild animals.

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Nue","
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected.
The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
The frog in the well knows not the sea, as they say.
If you truly believe yourself to be strong...
It won't do to be afraid
of plumbing into the depths of the open sea!

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Oh, what's the difference? I can imagine the gist of it 
by listening to stories about them right here!
Besides, you were still a pushover!

","Reimu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Saki","
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki,

we can finally act freely!

Excellent work! I see pretending to be used by Kicchou paid off,

wolf spirit!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Wolf)","
......Yes!

You overpraise me, Lady Kurokoma.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huh!?

Who on earth are you?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
......This human doesn't know of me, huh.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma,

boss of the Keiga Family.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
The Keiga Family......?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Wolf)","
(This person here's my boss.)


(The Keiga Family is an organization of animal spirits

who pride ourselves on our arms, swift legs and infinite courage.)


(We're the strongest group in the Animal Realm, y'know.)

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
She's your boss?

But then......

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Our brief deal with Kicchou in order to
defeat Keiki is now over.


Thanks to you defeating Keiki,

the Animal Realm has returned to being a competitive society.


And thus, the strongest, fastest army,

the Keiga Family, will rule all.


Soon the Animal Realm shall

come under our possession.


Perhaps not just the Animal Realm, but Hell and the Human Realm too......?

My dreams are broadening.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
You think it'll be that easy?


Roping me into the Animal Realm's conflict

was a mistake!


I'll beat you right here,

and smack you straight back into the Animal Realm!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice.


Unlike that foul Kicchou,

I happen to like fighting!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Wolf)","
......

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
You got that, wolf spirit?

Do all you can to help this human and come at me!
It won't be fun if she's

not as strong as when she defeated Keiki.
Now, show this jet-black pegasus

the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
......*pant pant*


Your power, swiftness, bravery and knowledge

in facing down danmaku... All in perfect balance!


I-I'm moved!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Is that so......

I'm completely worn out.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
I wonder,

would you consider joining the Keiga Family?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Hm?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
I'm busy with ruling the Animal Realm,

you see.


So I'll leave the Human Realm to you,

as the Human Realm division of the Keiga Family.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
What? That's ridiculous......

You think I'd agree to that?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Eh? How cruel of you to refuse......

To not rule over the Human Realm, even though you're so strong.


So then, why did you show me your strength?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Wait, is everyone in the

Keiga Family an idiot?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Wolf)","
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.


It is as you've seen. We are physically strong,

but our intellect is a bit...

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Whatever, then.

Guess I'll have to cut open a path myself.
I'll be calling on you when I visit the Human Realm next, okay?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huh? What for?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
A duel, of course.

I want to see your power without the wolf spirit.


If I win, I'll have you reconsider my proposition.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Benben","
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Though I can't make any promises,
since it depends on how the other youkai act.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
If those instrument tsukumogami
from earlier are involved...
Surely this is the work of
another instrument tsukumogami.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've finally come,
shrine maiden of Hakurei.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
But you're
too late now.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I was right, an instrument tsukumogami.
My intuition has finally returned.
Unfortunately for you, though,
now that the Miracle Mallet is recovering its power,
you'll go back to normal soon.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Really? And you thought your
intuition had returned?
I can stay like this
even without the Miracle Mallet.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I noticed right away that the Miracle Mallet
was the source of my power.
If I had just accepted that,
I wouldn't be truly independent.
So I had a thought. 
What if I discarded the Miracle Mallet's power
and replaced it with a different magic...?
Then I told all the
other tsukumogami about it.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
You replaced it with a different magic?
How did a mere tool figure that out...?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
My, my.
Tools would know better than anyone.
Because tools operate entirely
through the magic of their users.
So, shall I test my
new power on you?
Come, my drummer from the outside world!
Let your primal beat echo throughout Gensokyo!

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
How surprising!
I surrender?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
For a tool, that was quite a fight.
But you're not quite up to the level
of a full-fledged youkai yet.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
So I can't stand up to you using just
magic from the outside world...
But that doesn't matter,
since I learned I can fight quite a bit.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
But a spell to replace
your source of magic power...
I had no idea tsukumogami
had that kind of cunning.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Everyone works hard to
survive, right?
You can't call that ""cunning"".

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
By the way, what exactly is
the magic you're using now?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
The Magic Mallet was an exception,
since it empowered objects on its own, but...
Originally, a tool's magic power is that of its user.
Depending on the person using it, the magic changes.
So, I possessed a drum that had
floated in from the outside world.
The mystical power of a drummer from the outside world
is what fills my soul. That's what the spell is.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Huh.
I don't really get it, but it sounds convenient.
In any case, if they behave themselves, I...
won't attack tools.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Oh, thank you very much.
I won't defy you either, then.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Let the soul repose performance begin?!

","Reimu_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
W-well, that's different.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Ahhh, my true form has been uncovered
by an unidentified shrine maiden.
What am I going to do now?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Anyway, you need to fix all those seeds of
unknown form you scattered around.
It'll be easier for Byakuren's group to find the other pieces
of the Flying Granary that way, right?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Why do I have to help that monk......?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, she's
a friend of youkai, right?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Huh?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Especially youkai like you who were sealed away by humans.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I just want to scare people. That's why I ravaged the old world with the fear of my unknown form.
I haven't been above ground in a long time.
I had a lot of fun before my true form was revealed.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Wow, there's lots of clouds out now.
Where's that little snake?
Looks like I lost it.
It looks like there's lots of UFOs around here, though. I can just break open another one if I have to.
Hm?
I thought I heard something.
A bird?
No, this voice... it can't be...!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Why do I have to do it for you?
We're not underground anymore, so you can do it yourself.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Ah, well, it looks like I've gotten used to
this sort of remote operation...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Well, is the god here or not?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I don't know.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh, what a pain. I don't want to go home without a souvenir after coming all this way.
Will you play with me?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I thought it would be nice to kill some time... won't you?

"Aya","
(Just what we wanted!
Now, let's fight her the usual way!)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh, perfect! I like people with authority.
I guess there are strong people up here, too... My sister was talking about that recently.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Your sister?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
She said she was beaten by someone dressed in auspicious colors.
But, what kind of colors are those?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hmm, I'm not really sure, but maybe something like white and red... perhaps.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Ohoho, then that's perfect.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
You're the human that came down to the underground, aren't you?
My sister was talking about you... she said your power would be pretty useful.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Who's your sister?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
If I can take you alive, you'll be a great pet who can do the cleaning work of tons of spirits!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Wow, you're really strong! No way I can take you alive.
Are you really human?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Of course I'm human.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Hey, just a minute, you!)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Me?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(That was amazing.
Your power is really amazing.)
(I think I'd like to interview you some time,
if I may.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Interview me?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(I'd like to come visit you in your house.
Would you mind?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Oho? What happened while I was out?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Ah, I finally found you!
I've been looking for you, you know.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
You need something from me? Well, that's unusual.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Interview me at my house? If you can come all the way to the Palace of the Earth Spirits in the Former Capital, you're more than welcome too.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(The Former Capital... hmmm,
I don't know if I can go there...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Palace of the Earth Spirits? Reimu, who is this girl?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I don't know. She's some person from the underground.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Oh, that's right, we were visiting around the Palace of the Earth Spirits the other day, Kanako and I.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You were?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
We were looking for a high temperature, high pressure furnace to revolutionize the kappa's energy production.
We heard that the Remains of Blazing Hell wasn't being used anymore, so we went to go look.
We heard it was right under a building called the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Hm? Are you the mountain god that came to my house and gave Okuu that power?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Well, to be specific, it was Kanako.
Are you from the Palace of the Earth Spirits?
Sorry for borrowing that hell raven without your permission.
But, it looks like she's helped us create our Nuclear Furnace.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh, it's okay, it's great that Okuu got really strong. Please do it as much as you like.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What are you talking about?
I don't really understand what's going on, but are you planning something underground?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Come to think of it, the kappa have been really excited
lately... maybe it's related.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Wow, mountain gods, auspicious humans,
the above ground world is just full of strong people.
You're welcome to come to the Palace of the Earth Spirits any time you want.
We'll welcome you whenever you come.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
The Palace of the Earth Spirits? No thanks, that's where Satori lives.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh, you don't like my sister?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, she can read minds, you know? Wait, your sister!?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, where did that idiot go?
If what Aya said is true, all this fighting I had to go through was Kanako's fault.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(sniff sniff)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Uh, if you want to write an article, go ahead and do it.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(I am! It's focused on why
the gods of the mountain interfered with the underground.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
That's right, good luck.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh, what a good time to find a shrine maiden.
Do you know where the god of this shrine went?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Wah? I'm looking for her, too.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Heh? The shrine's maiden is looking for its god? That's funny.
She must be hiding, right?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Who is she? ... I can't imagine the tengu would
let a youkai like her onto the mountain.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hmmm? Wasn't there anyone in the shrine?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(I can't feel a thing coming from her, either.
Who on earth...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I'm Koishi Komeiji.
I came all the way from the underground world to visit.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
The underground?
I think maybe it's too easy to go back and forth between the two now...

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(In any case, it's not good for people to be able
to just come onto the mountain anytime they please.)
(Let's chase her away.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I don't really understand, but are you ready?
Let me tell you something good.
My sister could never win against me.
Why? I can act against the unconscious that she can't read.
The danmaku that lurk in your unconscious are danmaku that my sister has never seen!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nue","
I didn't know Byakuren was like that.
But, I got in Murasa's way, even though
she was trying to help Byakuren.
I'm the one that scattered the Flying Granary everywhere.
I can't show myself in front of them anymore.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, do whatever you want.
I won't seal you away for now, but...
At least, just for now, okay?
After all, I'm no friend of yours.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Hm, I'll just have fun
scaring some humans.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Wow, there's lots of clouds out now.
Where's that little snake?
Looks like I lost it.
It looks like there's lots of UFOs around here, though.
I'm sure there's someone suspicious around here.
Hm?
I thought I heard something.
A bird?
No, this voice... it can't be...!

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting
would be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Granary.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
This voice of misfortune!
It's the mysterious youkai from ancient times...
It's the voice of the nue!

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai
to save that monk,
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those
imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
So here it is, the mysterious flying youkai.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I hardly ever show myself before humans, you know?
You've just spent too much time sniffing around for me.
I suppose a human who could go all the way to Makai and back
like it was nothing is special.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What are those UFOs?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I put the Seed of Unknown Form in the Flying Granary.
The seed has the power to change shape into something
its observer can understand.
In other words, the UFO you saw
was just a figment of your imagination..

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Really? It's not easy to believe
it would look different to different people.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Oh, really?
But, you know......
That's what happened to people when they saw me-
they all had different descriptions, right?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, a nue has the head of a cat, the body of a chicken, and the tail of a snake, right?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Sure. But, I've never looked like that
when people saw me.
People have different perspectives, so even the form I take
has gotten quite vague over the years.
It makes things very difficult.
Well, it's also convenient.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Convenient?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
As a youkai whose specialty is being mysterious,
it makes it easy to play on people's fears.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
But now that you've seen me, I'll have to bury you
so I can go back to being an unknown.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hmph, so that's how it is!
Let's see what the legendary mysterious youkai
is really made of!

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
You human who's forgotten the fear of night!
Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl,
even if I've been asleep for so long......

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I guess anyone who doesn't want to show their true form
isn't all that, even if they're a legendary youkai.
Were you hiding out because you're so weak?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
The only reason I've been hiding for so long
is because I was shut away underground!
A long time ago, I was beaten by a cruel human.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
You did something bad, right?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I just made them afraid.
That's what youkai do, there's no helping it.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Nobody likes scary things.
It's natural a youkai like that would be hunted down.

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
But, you have bravery contests, right?
Aren't there people who like being afraid?

","Reimu_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I'm a little concerned about that power,
but whatever.
If you're going to get violent, too,
then I'll punish you right here!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Please just let me raise
a ruckus during concerts, okay?
The drummers in the outside world
have a saying.
""Awaken your caveman spirit,
for it doesn't need brains to beat a drum!""

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
What!?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I have obtained the magic
to become independent.
I no longer require the powers
of the Miracle Mallet.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Too late for what?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
But you're
too late now.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've finally come,
shrine maiden of Hakurei.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Did the Miracle Mallet cause
this storm, too?
What ominous power...

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Let the soul repose performance begin?!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
What?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Ah, wait.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
...And other humans, too. All right?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Why, thank you.
I swear to never raise a ruckus around the shrine maiden.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I've learned that you should hold memorial services
for tools that have become tsukumogami...
But with the purification rod thing,
and since this is a special case...
If you behave yourselves,
I might overlook it.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I was!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Aren't you a tool, too?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
...I see.
It must be painful being a tool.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Well, of course!
I had enough trouble just going out without it.
Tools should just settle for being used.
If they can't even do that, then they're just garbage.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
It is?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
For a tool, that was quite a fight. 
Man, whether it's the purification rod or whatever,
a world where tools run around causing havoc is a big pain.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
How surprising!
I surrender?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
The shrine maiden will just attack
youkai out of the blue.
In other words, that's proof that I, a tool,
have been acknowledged as a youkai.
Come, my drummer from the outside world!
Engrave your beat into this very battle!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
The rumors were true.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Huh.
...The outside world seems barbaric.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Now we won't be bound to anyone.
We are free!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Nue","
No, I don't want to be sealed away again?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
This voice of misfortune!
It's the mysterious youkai from ancient times...
It's the cry of the nue!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai
to save that monk,
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those
imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
So, that shape-shifting snake and those mysterious UFOs were all the work of the nue too, right?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Yes, wasn't it a nice show?
But, you humans were the only ones who thought
the fragments of the Flying Storehouse were UFOs.
Some people saw them as pieces of wood,
some as birds, others as beasts.
Maybe some people even saw them as danmaku.
Well, humans have amazing imaginations.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What were you after?
Wait, did you follow me all the way to Makai?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Oh, did you notice?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, anyone would think a weird shiny orb
following them is strange.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Well, I was just having so much fun
watching you.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
So, what were you after?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Wow, you're really weak.
Well, time to seal you away again.
Where would be good this time?
Maybe I should take you to Hokkai instead of Byakuren?
You won't be able to get back from there so easily.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl, even if I've been asleep for so long......

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
You human who's forgotten the fear of night!
Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
So you want to fight, huh?
Let's see what the legendary sealed youkai
is really made of!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Now that you've found out my true form,
I'll use all my powers to keep you quiet!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I don't want to ever be shut up in such a dark
and cramped place again, thank you!

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
It's too bad the underground got opened up......
It's been one disgusting youkai after another.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
It was terrible when my true form was revealed. Since this appearance was not dreadful at all,
I got locked in the underground after that.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
You haven't been above ground...?
Are you another one of those underground youkai?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
You fiend.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Don't worry, I'll tell her everything.
Some facts, and some lies...

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I'll have to go use my cute little familiars to
find all the pieces before she realizes it was me.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I bet she'll really put you through the wringer.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Well, I got in Murasa's way, even though
she was trying to help Byakuren.
I'm the one who scattered the Flying Storehouse fragments.
I hope she doesn't get mad, but......

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
I didn't know Byakuren was like that...
Oops.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Yes, I think she'd be willing to help
even a nue.
Even if the humans shunned you.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Monk? You mean Byakuren?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, that youkai-friendly monk built a temple.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Huh? What's the point, then?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Yes, you will.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Really?
I won't get sealed away just for being a youkai?
I won't get banished for massacring humans?

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
...... I'm just kidding.
Youkai are free to wander the earth these days.
Of course, we're also free to hunt them.

","Reimu_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting would be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Storehouse.

Thanks to you defeating Keiki,

the Animal Realm has returned to being a competitive society.


And thus, the strongest, fastest army,

Ah ha ha!

I can't stop laughing!

"Yukari","
(Hmm... good work, Reimu.

You really did well.)
(I see how all of this happened now.

You can go home and rest, in the hot springs or whatever.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Are you done talking?
I want to find a god with the gloomy power of love for my pets...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You think anyone would give you that kind of power?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I'm Koishi Komeiji,

A humble shrine visitor.
I came all the way here from the underground, but I can't find this shrine's god...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Komeiji...? I think I've heard that name before.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(You heard it in the Palace of the Earth Spirits, remember?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
You know about the Palace!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I went there a little bit ago.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Hey, are you...
The human my big sister was talking about?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I've got a bad feeling about this! Seriously.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
My sister said she'd got beaten by a strong, vicious, and empty-headed shrine maiden.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hey, if you're Satori's sister, does that mean... you can...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Read your mind?
I've already closed my satori eye.
Reading people's minds only makes you depressed and there's nothing good about it.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, thank goodness.
Well, I can't find Kanako or Suwako, so I think I'll be-

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Hey, just a minute!
I couldn't find the gods of the mountain, but I found a good human.
I was looking for the strong person who gave Okuu the power of the gods.
But, if you beat Okuu, that must mean you're even stronger!
I definitely want to see the power of the person even my sister couldn't fight!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
You sure aren't just any ordinary person.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(You really aren't, are you?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I told you, I'm just trying to be a normal human.
Anyway, why are you looking for the gods?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Well, they were able to make sis's Okuu really strong even though she's just a hell raven, right?
And when I asked her what happened, she said it was thanks to some mountain gods! It's really interesting, no?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Well, now, two visitors today? Excellent!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
There you are. Mountain god #2.
Where were you? I've been looking for you.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
I was just out on a shopping trip.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh, are you one of the gods of the mountain? Can I ask you something?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Reimu, who's this?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
She's Koishi, from Hell.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, where is that idiot, anyway?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Hecatia","
You're pretty interesting.
I see, I see~.
So this was a strategy from the lunar sage on Earth...
Hey, I'd kind of like to meet that sage~.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
I mean, if you're not a moon rabbit,
she's got no reason to hate you.
Maybe I'll search for some interesting
people in Gensokyo, too...?
If you've got anyone in mind, feel free to introduce me!

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
I heard about why you hate
the people of the moon.
Look, I can sympathize with your situation...
But the majority of the moon's people
have nothing to do with all that!
Didn't we settle this
in our last battle?
Why are the moon's people
still in here!?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
...The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were
unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin
into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself!
Hecatia, goddess of hell!

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Aw, geeze.
You totally kept me waiting, y'know.
So we're finally gonna get revenge on Chang'e, huh?
My fingers are so itching?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Ah, no. Your enemy is the rabbit
before you, not the moon's people.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Rabbit?
You mean a moon rabbit? One of Chang'e's minions?
Sure can't let her escape, in that case.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
W-who are you?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
I'm the goddess of hell, wielding three bodies
for the moon, the Earth, and the Otherworld.
I set a trap in the dream world
as part of Junko's plan.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
I see. You're the 'Master' who
that fairy on the moon mentioned.
That weird outfit of yours says it all.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
But hey, Junko?
Why'd you bring me out for one little moon rabbit?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
She's no ordinary rabbit.
She was the trump card of the moon's people.
It's thanks to this rabbit that we
were defeated, albeit only halfway.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Whaaaat?
How'd she do that...?
I can't believe a single rabbit
could ruin our whole plan.
Welp, nothing else to do.
Gotta get rid of her.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
So it's come to this after all.
I'm not even a moon rabbit any more, though...

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Moon rabbits are minions of Chang'e, my long-standing rival.
There's no way I can let this rabbit return alive.
I'll give you a real fun choice!
The moon, the Earth, or the Otherworld...?
Pick whichever body you want to be killed by!

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Two at once? Aren't you shamed to hold bare-knuckles?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Nah, see, it was just a little joke.
I lost the battle.
...now, you.
I caught on partway through, but...
You're not a moon rabbit, are you?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
No, I'm not.
I became a rabbit of Gensokyo!
I can't return to being a moon rabbit now.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
So you've come here again, hm...
There's no turning back now.
The lunacy of the moon's people
is nothing but poison to you by now!

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
...I also came here to extend
an invitation to you two.
However, as a condition,
you'll have to release the citizens in the dream world...
And promise never to attack
the Lunar Capital again.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Hey, Junko.
Is this okay?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
...it's fine.
Even if they return to the capital.
However, I can only accede to one of those conditions.
If, instead of ""never attack again,""
you make it ""don't attack for a while,"" I'll accept.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
...I understand.
That'll be fine.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Okay, okay.
Releasing the moon's people now.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
(There, just like Lady Eirin said.
They'll want to meet us anyway, so give them some conditions.)
(But they'll want to change one of the conditions,
so just accept those new terms.)
These two might be such a good match with Lady Eirin
and company that they can read each others' minds.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Hm?
Did you say something?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Whoops, said that out loud.
Nothing, it was nothing.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
You needn't worry.
For now, I have no desire for revenge.
In the first place, the people of the moon
living in Gensokyo are by no means my enemy.
That extends to you too.
Also...

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Oh, that's great.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
What is?

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
It sounds like Junko's taken
a bit of an interest in you.
It's thanks to you that she'll put a hold
on her revenge for a while.

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
O-oh, is that so.
I'm quite honored...

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
It took longer than I anticipated
for them arrive at this answer.
Since they came up with the scheme
to drop a moon rabbit to Earth,
I thought they'd realize it right away...

","Reisen","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Remilia","
If you say so, Sakuya, there's not much I can do. Shame, though.

Speaking of that immortal medicine... the Hourai Elixir...
It builds up in an immortal human's guts.
The elixir of immortality stands before us, although

she's rather beaten and tired right now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
A trial of guts?
For a human and youkai?
And under the true full moon to boot, in the dead

of night when only the plants are asleep?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Talking about eating a person's guts? This is a

pretty scary conversation you're having.
This isn't my trial of guts, is it?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
What's wrong with that? We're just enjoying this

nice, cool breeze a bit out-of-season.
You're a human, so just quiet down and entertain us

by becoming a monster for our trial.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady. Humans don't become monsters,

they just act like them.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Aren't there plenty of sinister spirits already?
Why would you need a human to go

to the trouble of acting like them?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
You said you're a human.
Why aren't you afraid of youkai, then?
Why aren't you quaking in fear of me?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Have you come for a ""trial of guts"",

or to give someone's guts a try...?
But, I have nothing to be afraid of any more.
No matter how many times I'm pierced

by arrows too fast to see,
No matter how many times I'm burnt

by divine fire that can consume a village in a moment,
I cannot die.
I can't test my guts anymore, either.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
This is wonderful, Milady.
You can drink her blood as much as you want. 

No matter how much you drink, she won't die.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
It's no good, Sakuya.
She's not human any more.

I only drink the blood of humans who fear me.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
My, that's too bad. I thought she might be like

that gourd that produces infinite liquor. 

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Are you really human?
If you are, forget about your trial and go home already.

This place isn't somewhere where you should be.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
She was speaking to us like there

was something here, though.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Oh, it looks to me like there is something here.

Right now, and slightly in the future.
Your knives are sharp, Sakuya, but your mind's a tad dull.
Kaguya wanted to lead us to this person, so she obviously

set us up on a trial of guts for that purpose. That has to be it.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Suika","
(Hey, remember the scary lady in the Palace of the Earth Spirits?
This is her little sister.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
That didn't hurt, but it sure does itch!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I can see how my sister, Okuu, and Orin wouldn't stand a chance against you.
My bullets can never hit you.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(zzzz... zzzz... oh,
hey, it's over?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
They're both out right now.
I'm watching the shrine while they're gone.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Mm, so they're gone...

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
What did you want to ask them? I can pass the message along.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
It was about the crow from underground... er, do you know what I'm talking about?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Of course I do. The hell crow with the yatagarasu, right?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Eh? How do you know about that?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Lady Kanako said it was her secret plan to revolutionize industry on the mountain.
She said if we could obtain clean energy, it would bring more believers to the shrine.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
The feeding of the crow was successful.
I guess you could say the first stage is complete.
She was a lot calmer than I imagined, and listened to what we had to say.
I thought she'd go wild above ground; this is kind of anticlimactic.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You mean my whole ordeal underground...
Was just to help out with your kappa industrial revolution?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Oh? You went underground? Why?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, whatever. I'm seriously tired, so I'm going back to have a bath and go to bed!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Yeah, it ended while you were passed out from drinking too much.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Anyway, why are you so strong?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, so I can take care of troublesome youkai like you, of course.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
That's boring! I'd use it to do something a lot more fun.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, youkai extermination can be pretty boring.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I'd start a love-stricken massacre! Or maybe pillage from a bunch of peaceful humans.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Well, she's a youkai, after all.
Why don't we play together next time you're above ground?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Wow, you're really nice!
It sure is fun up here.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hey, now! Don't make any weird promises for me!
And make sure I'm not around when you do that.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(By the way, Reimu?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Satori's mind reading is her weak point.
Koishi decided to close her third eye by herself.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
What are you talking to yourself about?
I can't read minds like my sister.
Please talk to me with words I can hear.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Her mind reading was a weakness, so she closed her third eye?
Well, then, she's just a regular youkai! This'll be an easy win.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Eh? Satori's sister?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Hmmm, are you the human who beat my sister and Okuu?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Something like that, yes.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
I wasn't able to find the god of the mountain, but I can't believe I met someone like you up here.
What a long trip it must have been!
Or maybe you're this shrine's shrine maiden?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
No, no, there's no way I'd live in a place way out in the sticks like this.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Really? Well, it doesn't matter.
If you beat my sister, I'd better test your power for myself.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Why did you come all the way out to this shrine?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, right. There's something I wanted to ask Kanako and Suwako.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Man, everyone's the same wherever I go.
Why do I have to keep fighting these people?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Reimu, Koishi has a power that compensates for
her sister's weak point.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Satori's weak point?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sanae","
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Where is that idiot, I wonder?
If what that hell raven said is true, all the fighting I've been through is Kanako's work.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Heeey!
Where are we off playing today?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Why is an oni talking to me through my orbs when I'm still above ground?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh, what a good time to find a shrine maiden.
Do you know where the god of this shrine went?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Wah? I'm looking for her, too.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Heh? The shrine's maiden is looking for its god? That's funny.
She must be hiding, right?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Huh?
That voice, that person...)
(You're Koishi from the Komeiji place, right?
What're you doing on top of a mountain like this?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Hmm? Have we met before?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh? You know her?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Oh, wow! You're not just any normal person, are you?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Who's that?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
You, obviously?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
No, I'm not asking who's a fool.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
So you're admitting to being a fool too, then.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
I'm a human who's lived here for a long time.

I'm not here because I'm a fool.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
A human?

A human, huh.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Maybe she owns the forest or something.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
So, what are you doing here, fools?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
A trial of guts.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
And of various other things.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
What! A trial of guts!?
Oh, since when have humans

been this foolish?
You come all the way out here in the dead of night,
with this lunatic full moon, and tons of youkai out,
for a trial of guts, of all things!?
It's a miracle that you weren't killed by youkai yet.
A trial of guts, seriously! If you die,

it'll be your guts the youkai will feast on---

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
She's just babbling.

Reimu, any counterattacks?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Ehh, well. We're just having this trial of guts

because Kaguya was saying 'hey, go on out there,' so...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
What was that?

Did you say ""Kaguya""?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Um, did I?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
You certainly uttered ""ka-gu-ya"".

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Rrrgh!

I figured your trial of guts was suspicious.
Of course she'd be behind this.
Yeah, she goaded the two of you into

getting rid of me this time, didn't she?
She always, ALWAYS tries to

do away with me!
Argh, and wasn't she the one who gave me

this inconvenient body in the first place!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Huh, she's getting all worked up on her own.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
See? If you don't take advantage of this, you'll lose.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Hmph. So, how about I see for myself

just how strong you messengers of Kaguya's are?
If she sent you, you must be

more powerful than her, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
How brave. To think that there'd be a human

brave enough to confront a youkai like me.
I only knew three others like that. 

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I'd kind of rather not fight

another human, though...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Just what you wanted.

Allow me to test your guts.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Ohhh man.

You're too strong...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Wow, look, she's still alive.

She really can't die, huh?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I'm seriously surprised. It looked like

she was about to die a bunch of times.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Ow, ow! I won't die, but it still hurts~.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Reimu, this girl is quite interesting.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Er, looking at her in pain and saying ""that's interesting""
is a bit, uh...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
If you're this strong, there's no point

to a trial of guts, is there?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Really?

There's still various things that I'm scared of.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Like manju?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Yeah, they're shaped like giant insect eggs.

And then that jelly inside is like...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Oh noooo. Manju are so scary. 

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, anyway, is our trial of guts finished?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Oh?

Now that you mention it, we haven't tried any guts yet.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
See? The human in front of us is full of guts.

Reimu, you cut out her guts and give them a try.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Eeeek.

I won't die, but that's scary.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Why on earth should I have to

do something so youkai-like?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Well, if you eat an immortal person's guts,

you'll become immortal too.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
That said, I'd rather not

stop being human, y'know...?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Oh, that's mean. Are you saying I'm not human?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Are you human...?

I don't really know.
Well, in any case, Gensokyo is full of things

that you can't tell are human or not anyway.
I guess it wouldn't matter much these days

if the container for your soul is different.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Youkai extermination is the duty of the Hakurei, though.

Would that be youkai discrimination?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Okay, I take that back. Youkai should be exterminated.

Humans should do the exterminating.
It's an unshakable contract we have.

I'll keep exterminating youkai from now on.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Right you are.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Are you the ""guts"" in this trial of guts?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I wonder what that was about.

It does feel like the fairies are pretty rowdy tonight...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
The moon tonight is especially strong.
It's no wonder that all the creatures are rowdy, really.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
So there are even fools who'd go out on a night like this, huh?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
What are you saying?

You were fine fighting Marisa, weren't you?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Don't go thinking I'm some ordinary human.
I won't die. I'm completely unable to die.

Thanks to that lousy Kaguya.
Yes, no matter how hard she tries to eliminate me,

it won't do her any good at all.
She knows that, and she still sends you messengers.

This cannot get any more annoying.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Look, Reimu.

You missed another opportunity.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I still don't quite get it.
But if she won't die, that means

I can go all-out on her, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
More or less. Although it looks like the ""completely

unable to die"" part is just her being full of herself.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
If you don't go all out,

it's game over for your life.
There's no turning back now.

It's a one-way street in the dead of night.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sanae","
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Huh. Koishi, a little rock? ... I thought she was a youkai. Well, what is it? 

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Is it okay to call gods idiots?

Well, I guess it is.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
If what that hell raven said is true, all the fighting I've been through is Kanako's doing.
Is she trying to take over the underground, too?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh, what a perfect time to find a shrine maiden.
Do you know where the god of this shrine went?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh? I was just looking for them, too.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Heh? The shrine's maiden is looking for its god? That's funny.
You must be hiding them, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Who are you?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Koishi","
Mm. I was hoping I could get maybe a god for one of my pets.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
...... what do you mean?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh yeah, now I remember.

Were you up to something in the underground world?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
Underground...? Are you talking about our Mountain Industrial Revolution project?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Industrial revolution project??

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
We've been inspecting the kappa's industrial facilities.

They're pretty backwards compared to the outside world.
Kanako said that if they could find a new energy source, it would create a revolution.
You see, Kanako loves technological revolutions.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(So, you sent the yatagarasu underground

in order to obtain atomic energy?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suwako","
I told her ""wouldn't nuclear power be dangerous for the kappa?"", but still....
So? How did it go?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hey, you guys...
Next time, tell everyone about it before you start!
I had to go all the way to the Hell of Blazing Fires because of you!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Extra","Subterranean_Animism"
"Sakuya","
Er, well, we're having a trial of guts...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Who would eat a human's guts?
And who told you that, anyway?
Wait, no, I probably know who it was already.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
As we can't have a death penalty here, of course.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Oh, what about the Yama?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Should you be stronger than the Yama,
you could do as you please.
That's the way of this place... no, of all places.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Stronger how exactly? Financially?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
In wisdom.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Well, to which person of wisdom am I speaking?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
I heard about you from Ran.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Oh, I've become famous now.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Yes, I've always wanted to meet someone as famous as yourself.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
So much that it woke you right up, I see.
Sorry I can't give you my autograph.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
That's alright, your handwritten duplicity would be sufficient?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
...Handwritten?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
You have not yet noticed.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
That you have no wisdom at all?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
...That the borders between the pure land and hell are fading.
This place has become a lawless land of oni.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Hell is not as scary as Makai.
Oni, compared to the devil, are nothing at all.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
You cannot scurry away;
Beyond here only lies the worst of Hell.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
It's all right, as long as I have one thread of spider's silk,
I can find a way to Heaven.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Hahaha...
Even when the way through my danmaku is thinner,
And more intricate than any spider's web?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Ahh, feels like I'm in heaven.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
I never expected anyone could make their way through?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
A spider's silk can capture things far larger than the spider itself.
Like, say, a butterfly.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Ah, so that's it. If you see a spider at night,
someone's going to raid your house.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Don't call me a thief.
Though I suppose with this maid uniform, it's quite unusual to get into trouble.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Well, at least there's nothing worthwhile in my house.
Still worth a lot more than the shrine on the same border though.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
That goes without saying.
You wouldn't have anything in your house if all you ever do is sleep.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
That's rude.

My house is full of nice things.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
That's not what you just said.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
My futon, for example.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Nobody's going to steal that...

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
And my pillow.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Okay, so there's nothing really...

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
But sometimes things wash up on the shore.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
...is there a sea around here?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yukari","
Like human children. Or adults.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
You'd better return them to where they were.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
Finally, we meet again.
Today, I have now become... 
freshly and newly possessed!

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Hey, I've seen this kitty before. Did you die to get here?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
When I look again,
it's really a large garden.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
I smell a human~

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Oh, I'm mistaken.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
No, you aren't.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Apparently you're alive...
Well, I'm not really sure. Are you dead?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Appearance is enough to judge.
And apparently you're a fox.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
And apparently you're a dog.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Don't judge something by looks alone.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Don't mistake me for a simple beast either.
I am the shikigami of a powerful master.
As such, my powers far exceed those of any youkai you've ever seen...
Not to mention those of humans. Or dogs.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
There's not much difference between shikigami, cats, and foxes.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
And where'd you see a cat?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Just back there, near the stairs.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
That's a great change of subject.

What do you mean?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
This time, I see a fox.
It's full of animals around here.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
...So you met Chen?
I've been searching for her.
She is always restless like a cat, and now she's disappeared.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Too bad for you,
That cat went to the mountain to do laundry.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Is that so?
Maybe I should return to the hills too then.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
A fox goes into the hills to die.
As this is the Netherworld, it will be a fitting grave for you.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Ha.

I bet you are the one who tormented Chen, aren't you?
Chen is my shikigami.

I must take revenge for her.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
She's a youkai's shikigami's shikigami?

I thought it was something like that.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Well then, go back to the hills or wherever.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Ouch...
Chen's probably depressed too since she's no longer shikigami possessed.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
So I've defeated these annoyances.
However, I sense there's a mastermind of this whole mess.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Help me Master Yukari~
This is more than I can handle...

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
More annoyance than you can cause?
What exactly is your master doing,
leaving her shikigami running around like this?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
Sleeping.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Then wake her up.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
I have to go back to the hills in order to wake her up.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
So she's not around then...
Master of such an annoying shikigami, eh.
I bet she must be even more annoying than this one.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
...I don't deny that.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Anyway, I'll be back when your master is awake.
In the meantime, wake her up properly.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
You aren't quite making sense.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Just do it.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
*sob*

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Ran","
You again?
I'm tired today.
I was just about to go to sleep...

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
I'll let you really rest in peace this time.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
So, is law enforcement around here
always like this?

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
There's no law in the world of the dead.

","Sakuya","Extra","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Tsukasa","
I let you off easy before,
since you seemed useful......
But if you're going to cause trouble in the
tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I can breathe just fine.
It seems like this magatama card's
power is the real deal.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You're... not Tsukasa.
Who are ya!?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I am Sakuya Izayoi, employed at the
Scarlet Devil Mansion as a maid.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
...Huh. Never heard of ya.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Junko","
...The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were
unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin
into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself!
Hecatia, goddess of hell!

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Aw, geeze.
You totally kept me waiting, y'know.
So we're finally gonna get revenge on Chang'e, huh?
My fingers are so itching?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Ah, no. Your enemy is the human
before you, not the moon's people.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Human?
For real? Like, they're physically here?
Hmm...
Let's have a look-see.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Mmm. Two enemies, huh?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Oh, does it look like two?
Heh heh heh.
Well, all right.
So this human's been giving you a hard time, Junko?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
It wasn't merely a 'hard time'.
It's thanks to this human that we
were defeated, albeit only halfway.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Whaaaat?
She's that strong...?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
The moon's people were quite cunning,
sending this human to fight me.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Hmm, interesting.
If you're saying that much, they must be the real thing.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
This sure is a dangerous atmosphere...
Maybe I ought to retreat for now
and call in some allies.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Aw, c'mooon. You don't have to be that scared of me, you know?
I'm not going to fight you seriously.
It kinda seems like Junko's
prepared for defeat, anyway...
It doesn't really matter who wins or loses any more.
So we're gonna fight you one at a time, nice and fair!
This is just a bit of entertainment.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Oh, really?
That's a relief.
In that case...
Do battle with me at once! You freaky T-shirt weirdo!

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
All right. You're a cute little thing,
so I'll play with you a bit.
Usually, I'd rather not fight
the likes of a human, but...
""You totally insulted me just now.""
For that reason alone, I'll drop you into hell.
For that reason, and no more!
Now, suffer even in death!

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Hey, you broke your promise!
You both attacked at the end!

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Oh, hey, sorry about that.
The battle's over already. I lost.
You're as amazing a human
as Junko said.
Honestly, attacking Gensokyo?
When there's such amazing humans there?
I'm finding it kinda hard to forgive the moon's people.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Just the same, I'd like you to release
those hard-to-forgive people now.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Hey, Junko?
Is this okay?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
...it's fine.
Even if they return to the capital...
Thanks to my encounter with this human,
I've lost my will to fight.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Sure thing, sure thing.
Releasing the moon's people now.
They ought to pull out
of Gensokyo now, too.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Really?
You already tricked me once before,
so I don't know if I can trust you.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
We have no intent to deceive.
I never thought that the moon's people
would take all of Gensokyo hostage.
My plan only indirectly resulted
in Gensokyo being attacked.
The people of the moon are our only enemies.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Well... okay.
Oh, now that you mention it.
There's some moon people living in Gensokyo.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Yeah, them.
What about them?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
How about you go and
protest to them a little?
As delegates of the moon's people.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Oh, that could work.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
But just by speaking, of course?
Violence isn't a good thing!

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Mmm, but what if they use violence
against us first?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Then fight them as you please!
Just like us a minute ago!

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Ahahaha~.
You're funny?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Heh heh heh. For now, I have no desire for revenge.
It seems it'll be a long time
until my next revenge drama.
Thanks to you.

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
So you've come here again, hm...
I told you, didn't I?
If you had made it all just a dream back then,

you wouldn't be seeing such a lunatic dream now...

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Nue","
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected.
The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
The youkai's trump card, huh?
I wonder if it's a gashadokuro?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Hey, I'm not some pile of bones.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Who might you be?
The Hakurei shrine maiden?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
No, I'm not.
Please don't group us together like that.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Oh, my sincerest apologies.
You seemed to be a shrine maiden, so...

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Are you the youkai trump card
Nue was talking about?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Indeed I am.
I am Futatsuiwa from Sado.
I was called so that saint
wouldn't be allowed to have her way.
Now, who might you be?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Oh, um, I'm Sanae.
I'm a shrine maiden in Gensokyo.
I'm doing some youkai extermination
to help raise my faith.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
My, aren't you an odd one?
How unusual to say that before a youkai.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Why don't I spar with you a bit, then?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
I was just thinking the same thing,
Miss Tanuki.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Ho! Ho! Ho!
How long will you keep that confidence?
Now, shall we begin?
a ten-game match of danmaku transformations!

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
*cough*, *cough*

Pray, might I be granted a brief respite?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Yes, I'd like to take a break, too.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
I must say, you are quite strong.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
I am, right?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
I once had enough power to hold sway
over one third (of the tanuki) of Japan.
But perhaps that's a thing of the past, now.
To think I lost to a human like this...
Perhaps that nue overestimated my strength?
I wonder...

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
...
Ummm...
May I say something?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Oh, what is it?
Do you mean to catch me and make me into stew?

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
No, I don't think I'd want
to eat something so gamey.
Geting all depressed won't solve anything!
You'll only sell yourself short if you think
you're no good because you're so old.
Stay in the fight!

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Er, well, that is...
The way I speak is a habit of mine.
I don't believe I'm particularly old.

","Sanae","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Tsukasa","
I let you off easy before,
since you seemed useful......
But if you're going to cause trouble in the
tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Are you finished getting ready?
You cowardly thief!

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You're... not Tsukasa.
Who are ya!?

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
I am Sanae Kochiya,
the Moriya Shrine maiden.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
The Moriya Shrine, huh?
Ahh, yep. That's your
despicable face, all right.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I would imagine so.
And you are?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Ah, beg your pardon.
The name's Momoyo.
I'm the Rainbow Dragon Cave's foreman.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
The foreman?
I see...
So that Misumaru person wasn't in charge.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
""Misumaru""?
Who's that?
*Gasp*, are they that thief
Tsukasa mentioned?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Ironic that you would call me a thief.
Isn't your band of youkai,
led by an oomukade...
The ones who are digging up the Youkai Mountain
and stealing the Izanagi Objects?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Another one of ya!? Who are you!?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
I am Misumaru Tamatsukuri,
the rightful owner of the dragon gems.
Your actions have been wholly unacceptable.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Whazzat?
Rightful owner?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Another one!
You thieves are just pilin' on in here, aren'tcha?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Momoyo, I'm not a thief.
I'm Tsukasa.
This colorful ""Misumaru"" character
is the thief that I mentioned.
She's colluding with the human before you
to steal all the dragon gems from the mountain.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
...

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
But Master Iizunamaru doesn't
know about this yet.
I shall return and report to her,
so that she may pass her judgement.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
*Chuckle*. Hang on.
You just said that Iizunamaru doesn't
know about these two being here, yeah?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......That is correct.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Well, ain't this a chance to go all out?
We don't need the tengu's judgement just for
some petty thieves. I can make the call myself.
I'll pummel 'em into the dirt here and now!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Ah, I see. Everyone seems to be being played
against each other by that lying fox.
I am not a thief, and it's likely
that Misumaru isn't one either.
The Great Tengu you call Iizunamaru
also doesn't wish for any battle, either.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Ahahah!
No way!
Iizunamaru loves to fight!
And I don't really care if
you guys are thieves or not.
I just want a good fight, myself!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
It seems that a battle is unavoidable.
You must win against her.
Let me lend you a bit of strength.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Have you chosen a good card?
Well then, Sakuya Izayoi, brace yourself and fight!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Wh-- Please wait!
I really just wanted to
talk to Misumaru...

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Are you done preparing?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Fine.
We just have to fight, yes?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
I've been looking for someone who I'm allowed
to fight without holding anything back!
Tremble in joy!
The mountain shall be your grave!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
...That...
felt AWESOME!
That was a blast! I got to shoot
all the danmaku I could ever want!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Don't underestimate maids!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
A ""maid"", huh?
So maids were a race of ferocious butchers.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
It's not a race,
it's an occupation.
Now then, I had some business
with Misumaru, but...

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Misumaru's that lady who made
a break for it just now, right?
Who was she?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Who knows...
I have no idea either.
Our resident witch told me to
come here and look into it, but...

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
...You called?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Woah!
Where did you come from!

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
I was quietly watching your violent
behaviour from over there.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Wonderful.
I have quite a lot to ask you.
First, do you know about the relationship
between the dragon gems and the Ability Cards?

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
The cards are a type of magic item
that the great tengu created.
They seem to be utilizing dragon gems,
which can seal souls within them,
but the detailed mechanism behind them is a mystery to me.
After all, the dragon gems alone shouldn't be sufficient
for maintaining the cards' supply of magic.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I see... Thank you so much.
Next is about the Izanagi Objects.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
An Izanagi Object is...

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Oi, oi. If you're gonna drone on about
boring stuff, feel free to do it outside.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Ah, excuse us.
Miss Misumaru, do you mind coming
to the Scarlet Devil Mansion?
Our resident witch may barrage
you with questions, mind.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Very well.
Ah yes, about your prior question.
Izanagi Objects are dangerous,
so it's best to not dig them up.

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Eh?
What did you just...

","Sakuya","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Raiko","
You've come here to clean up the mess from the
Mallet's magic power, right?
It's too late for that.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Too late?

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Even I have heard about
the Miracle Mallet incident.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've finally come,
human maid.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I decided not to use this bewitched blade
anymore, but...
Since I there are still youkai being affected by the Mallet's magic,
I suppose I had no other choice.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
If it were to become a tsukumogami using my magic,
it would become far too powerful...

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Oh, why?

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Hmmm...
Maybe I should?
No, I shall have to decline.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I know you're hiding it.
The blade in your hand... It's suffering.
...Would you like to hear more
about how to release the magic power in it?

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I-I was just speaking hypothetically.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Hmm, let's see...
If the user had a strong spirit, then probably.
But since the Mallet's magic is still intact,
its magic could affect you.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Just hypothetically,
If there was a blade that was desecrated by
the Mallet's power and started causing problems...
If that blade changed hands,
would that mean the magic power would be changed?

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
That's right, but it just means I've changed users.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Let the soul repose performance begin?!

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
By the way,
you mentioned before that you replaced the magic power.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I guess I still haven't mastered
this new magic yet.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Wow,
you were pretty tough.
Not the
easily-exterminated type, I see.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
How surprising!
I surrender?

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
My, my.
It's simple because I'm a tsukumogami.
Because when a tool's user changes,
their magic power changes, too.
Now, shall we test out
my new magical power?
Come, my drummer from the outside world!
Awaken primal emotions with your soul's beat!

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
You replaced it?
Tsukumogami can do that...?

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I no longer require
the Miracle Mallet.
For I have replaced the cursed Mallet's power
with a different magic.

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Oh, I see.
Then you understand why I am here,
yes?

","Sakuya_A","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
...No thanks!
I'd very much not like to do that.
I don't want to go back to a life of
being hit and stepped on.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
What will you do?
If you wish to return to being a tool, I shall help.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Oh.
Maybe...

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Hmmm... Wait, since you are a tsukumogami now,
that does not apply to you anymore, correct?

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Is that right?
But things like borders don't mean anything to us tools.
We can come and go as we please.
Tools from the outside float here
on their own all the time, don't they?

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Oh, that is a perilous idea.
Interfering in the outside world could lead to problems...

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
It's a drummer from the outside world.
Strange power continues to flow through me.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
This new magic...
I have a feeling I know, but what is it?

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I guess I still haven't mastered
this new magic yet.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Wow,
you were pretty tough.
Not the
easily-exterminated type, I see.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
How surprising!
I surrender...

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
My, my.
It's simple because I'm a tsukumogami.
Because when a tool's user changes,
their magic power changes, too.
Now, shall we test out
my new magical power?
Come, my drummer from the outside world!
Let your visionary beat resound throughout Gensokyo!

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
You... replaced it?
Tsukumogami can do that?

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
I have replaced the cursed Mallet's power
with a different magic.
I no longer require
the Miracle Mallet.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Too late?

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Too bad.
Not a single part of me wants to return to being a mere tool.
And besides, you're too late anyway.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Oh, is that so?
You must be having a hard time
in the middle of this storm.
I shall take the Mallet's magic back
and return you to being a tool.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Raiko","
Even I have heard about
the Miracle Mallet incident.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've finally come,
human maid.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
The storm is clearly not natural.
Powerful magic is interfering with
the atmosphere and causing a magical storm...!

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
You are a drum, yes?
How could you not want to be hit?

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Let the soul repose performance begin!

","Sakuya_B","Extra","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sanae","
Head back? Where to?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
We~ell,
seems like it's about time for us to head back, huh?

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Hecatia","
Back to Earth.
We're not people of the moon, after all.



","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
It took longer than I anticipated
for them arrive at this answer.
Since they came up with the scheme to use a human,
I thought they'd realize it right away...

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
So we meet again!
This time, I shall certainly defeat you!

","Sanae","Extra","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Mokou","
Hrm.

Kaguya, you say?
So that's it. I did think it was strange that a

human and youkai were having a trial of guts here.
She's always trying to eliminate me.

She's always sending assassins.
And even though she knows I'll never die!
Kaguya's the one who made the Hourai Elixir, right?
I wish she'd just give this a rest already.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
See, Sakuya?

Kaguya was using us, just like I said.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Indeed. So you're saying you went along with it

because it seemed interesting, Milady?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Well, no, to kill time.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
The guts of this trial are the smoke of Mount Fuji.

The eternal volcanic ash, reaching to the moon.
An ever-resurrecting immortal bird,

born from unextinguishable flames.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
A legendary phoenix, growing in strength with each rebirth.

The bullets of this evening will be the young lady's eternal trauma.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Aw, maaan.

I can't take any mooore.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Huh?

Surrendering already? You're all bark and no bite.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
I've had enough already~.

Please don't taunt a human who can't die.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Oh, yeah. You're a human who can die, Sakuya.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
What an ominous comment.

Hearing it from Milady, it doesn't sound like a joke.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
I may not be dying any time soon,

but I really can't keep fighting~.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
So, how about you become immortal too, Sakuya?
Then we can be together forever.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
I'll be a mortal human as long as I live, thank you.
Don't worry, though. We'll be together as long as I'm alive.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
I don't recommend becoming immortal.
They might not look it, but these bruises

you gave me are really painful.
Although I won't die even if it hurts.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
That's what ""a trial of guts"" means, right?

Right, mortal Sakuya?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
You learn such bizarre things when you spend time

with Lady Patchouli. It's a bit troubling.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
My, you've certainly changed.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Well, I suppose these attacks are above average,

but it's not much of a trial of guts.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
It's the dead of night, and non-humans are fighting each other.
A brutal night, with neither humans or youkai around.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Maybe that's because it's a full moon tonight?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Sorry, but I'm human.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Really?

Sorry to say, though, but I'm human too.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, we came at just the right time.

There's a human, in a place like this.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Just the right time?

It's still a bit early for a meal, isn't it?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
So, the young lady there is a youkai?

Although I guess that was obvious from the wings and all.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Don't lump me in with mere youkai.

I'm proud and noble...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
There's no need to be proud and noble

at a time like this.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
So, what would a human and a youkai

be doing together here?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Oh, honestly.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Still, if you have that much strength,
why would you fear that saint so?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
I wasn't afraid of her.
I already fought her and won.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
What was that?
Then, why on earth did I come all this way
from far-off Sado?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Who knows? Why not try asking
the folks here at the temple?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
A temple?
However, I'm a youkai tanuki...

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Oh, the Myouren Temple is a youkai temple.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Is that so? How interesting.
A youkai exterminating shrine and a youkai temple...
What an interesting place this is.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
By the way, you said
you came from Sado, right?
Where is Sado?
What kind of place is it?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Would you like to hear more about me?
Telling all might take a while.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Oh, nevermind, then.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Surely you needn't have said as much...
In any case, why don't we wait until
we've rested a bit in the temple to talk?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Nue","
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected.
The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
What might you be?
Are you a youkai?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
I don't want that either!

Just don't ignore me.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Heeey.


You guys are kinda leaving me behind...

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Eagle)","
I'll leave it up to your imagination.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Meaning......

You want to monopolize the Primate Spirit Garden?


That or the unidentified dark organization, huh?

Either way, she's being way too greedy.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Eagle)","
That's not it. Lady Toutetsu has no interest

in either the Kiketsu or the Keiga Families.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Then let me guess.


You two were plotting to secretly

gang up on the Keiga Family or something?

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Eagle)","
......


I have no need to tell you about this.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Well, aren't you honest?
You've caught my eye.


However, eagle spirit.

There is something I don't understand regarding you.


Why did the Gouyoku Alliance agree on

cooperating with Kicchou to defeat Keiki?

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
......*pant pant*, thank god.

I couldn't hold on anymore.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
No, let's stop here.

If we keep going at it, one of us will fall.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
I can still fight!

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
......*pant pant*


Your power, swiftness, bravery and knowledge

in facing down danmaku... All in perfect balance!


I-I'm moved!

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Eagle spirit of the Gouyoku Alliance!

I see you've found a good human!


But I'll have you know that I'm strong.

Hold nothing back and come at me!


Now, show this jet-black pegasus

the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Eagle)","
Human...... I'll lend you my power!

Together, we can stop the boss of the thugs!

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Heh heh, just what I like to hear.


Unlike that two-faced Kicchou,

you are determined and elegant.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
No need to panic, eagle spirit.


I came here to stop the invasion in the first place.


In other words, all this means is that

I've found my target.


Everything I've done has been

to defeat her!

","Youmu (Eagle)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Ahh.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

This is a dragon gem mine. It's a prime spot for
getting dragon gems, which are a rare earth element.

an' give off different glows in response.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Huh, that sounds beautiful.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Well they are!
But that's not all.
They glow in different colors
'cause they're copying the magic.
Using dragon gems lets you
copy others' abilities.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

I see, and that's how the Ability Cards work...

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Well, they can copy the magic, but apparently
you can't activate 'em on their own.
I dunno how they completed
the Ability Cards, myself.
I think Iizunamaru said that...
they made use of the market god's power.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

...I understand.
Thank you so much.
Umm, what was your name again?

appearance lets on, Miss Momoyo.

Perfect! I'll take you up on that offer!
Time for a rematch, right now!

Ah, I'm sorry.
Your looks weren't deceiving, after all.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

*Chuckle*. Hang on.
You just said that Iizunamaru doesn't
know about these two being here, yeah?

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......That is correct.

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Momoyo","
Well, ain't this a chance to go all out?
We don't need the tengu's judgement just for
some petty thieves. I can make the call myself.
I'll pummel 'em into the dirt here and now!

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
......

","Sanae","Extra","Unconnected_Marketeers"

How unfortunate. We're about to get into a
pointless fight, thanks to that fox's prodding.

Oh well, do whatever horrible thing you please.

","Sanae_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Well, it's not like I fought you because I wanted
to do something horrible to you.
What was that UFO, anyway?
Why didn't it look like a UFO to Byakuren?
I just wanted to get the answer to those questions.

","Sanae_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Well, I'm a youkai whose true form is unknown.
I put the Seed of Unknown Form on the fragments of the Flying Storehouse.
That seed has the power to change form into
whatever is in the head of the person looking at it.

had to be a UFO, you saw a UFO.
To people who knew of the Flying Storehouse,
they saw its fragments.

So, the UFO was really only in my head?
Why did you do that, then?

","Sanae_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Well, I thought it would get in Murasa's way,
and it would make the humans scared.
But it looks like you weren't scared at all.
And on top of that, it looks like
it made you help out Murasa's group.

","Sanae_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Well, humans love UFOs, you know?
There's no way we'd be scared of them.

","Sanae_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

unidentified flying objects these days?

","Sanae_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

That's right, this is an age where
an old flying umbrella won't scare people.

","Sanae_A","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

I just went on a rampage in my true form.

","Sanae_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nue","
Hmm, so aliens
are something unidentified, right?

","Sanae_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
No, not really, I mean, they've already classified
a bunch of different kinds of aliens.
Like the Little Greys, the Oranges, Venusians...
They're pretty well known.

","Sanae_B","Extra","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Hello, there!

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
The youkai's trump card?
So I guess Miss Miko's group
weren't youkai after all.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Ummm, well, I'm kind of like a half youkai......

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Hm, how indecisive.
I've been told the youkai are in fear of
the resurrection of that saint.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
I've come to give 'em a pep talk.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Oh, I'm okay.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
By the by, I don't sense the aura of a youkai
around you at all.
Are you truly a youkai?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
I'm half-human, half-phantom.
I don't know if you could call me a youkai or not...

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Hm, I believe I don't understand.
In any case, why not allow me to train you,
as a first class youkai?

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
No, thank you.

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
Come, now, was it not the youkai of Gensokyo
that claimed to be in danger from that saint's return?

Don't expect to make it through these times alive
with such a half-baked response!
Allow me to do some strict training with my
ten-game match of danmaku transformations!

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Mamizou","
*cough*, *cough*

Er, hmm, I suppose that will do.
You've gotten strong enough now.
Yes, you may now consider yourself an initiate!

","Youmu","Extra","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Didn't you say you wanted to take on

the trial of guts, and asked me to come along?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Oh, right, that.
So why have you been saying ""raw guts"" this,

""raw guts"" that for a while now?
I gave up on the trial already.

I realized it was just Kaguya tricking us.
She obviously just wanted us to fight this human.

The trial of guts was all a lie.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Gave up? You just paused, right?

The trial of guts starts again from here on.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Uhh...

Honestly, I'm bad with scary things...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Hey, look, there's a phantom under that tree...!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Eeeeek!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
...this may be a trial of guts, but I'm not scared of you!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
The attacks just... stopped, all of a sudden.

This is when things are at their scariest.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
A phantom, dressed loudly and conspicuously.
And in the dead of night, when even the plants are asleep under the full moon.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Seeing phantoms isn't rare, but your appearance

definitely stands out.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Wah, someone's there!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu, there she is.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Funny for a phantom to be saying that.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
......

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
What, a human?

I was about to slash her by mistake.
...but, wait, a human at this hour?

That's definitely weird!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
............

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
I live around here to begin with.

Time aside, you two are far more unusual.
So, what business do you have here?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
We're here for a trial of... uh, Lady Yuyuko?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu, don't get close to her.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko...?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
That girl is different from other humans.
Don't touch her.

Her curse will be passed on to you.
Don't eat her.

Her poison will curse you, too.
Above all else...

My powers can't affect her.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
That's a pretty sour way to talk about someone

you've only just met.
And what are these ""powers"", huh?

What were you trying to do?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko can invoke death in humans.

But if it doesn't work on you--

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
So you tried to take my life right off the bat?

You're pretty dangerous phantoms.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Aren't you human?
Well, then, I don't understand why

Lady Yuyuko would be afraid of you.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Unfortunately, yes, I am human.

I just sort of can't die, is all.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
A person of Hourai...

This is scary, Youmu.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
You were fine with this trial of guts up

until now... did you eat something funny?
Well, I'll just do something about this myself.
I would never have thought something could frighten

the unshakable Lady Yuyuko.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Shouldn't I get along well with phantoms?
This is somehow irritating.

Maybe I should just start attacking now~?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
But what is so frightening about her,

Lady Yuyuko?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
A human who has drunk the Hourai Elixir will become unable to age or die.
If another human eats that immortal human's guts,
that person too will never age and never die.
And if a ghost eats them...?
An undying ghost will be born.
Thus, the cycle of Hourai ends. They'll never achieve nirvana

or reincarnate, and the elixir will stop along with them.
Well, I guess it'd be fine if you didn't eat them.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Then don't eat them!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
My god, you're such noisy phantoms.
If I turned into a phantom myself,

would I be as crazy as you two?
I guess I'll never know, since I won't die.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
I was a fool for worrying.

Lady Yuyuko is Lady Yuyuko, after all.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
I might still eat them~.

Those eternally fresh, raw guts look pretty tasty to me.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
I'll take care of what your powers can't reach, Lady Yuyuko.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Can the dead really strike the living, in the end?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
We may not be able to make you one of us,

but let's give this a try and see if you really are immortal.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Ghosts who have forgotten nirvana cannot be reborn.

A human who cannot die will not know the vivid Netherworld.
As one really lives, lives, lives, she doesn't know the start of life.

As one really dies, dies, dies, she doesn't know the end or death.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
As I do not know death, I have surpassed that darkness.

See this beautiful danmaku, unchained from the dark samsara!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
What the?!

I'm reaching my limit, here...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Even if you're immortal, your body still has its limits.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Okay, our opponent can barely move.

Now!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
What do you mean, ""now""?

We're not eating her, right!?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
I can't die, but I can't keep fighting like this.

My body hurts all over.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Being a ghost is nice.

Your body never hurts. What do you say to being one?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Are you even listening to me?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
A human that can't die sure is interesting.

I can use my full power without any hesitation.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
My, were you holding back the whole time?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Good heavens, no.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
That aside, you're very strong.

Why is that?
I guess everyone's just younger than I am?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
A human would obviously have limits

to their strength, wouldn't they?
You can try all you like, but you can't beat a phantom.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
I don't think being phantoms had much to do with it,

but it was rather that there were two of us...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Oh, my. There's some eternally fresh, raw guts

before us. How rare.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mokou","
Oh, fine.
It hurts too much to move,

so boil me, roast me, whatever!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Boiling or roasting would be no good!
You have to eat the guts raw.

Boiling or roasting would neutralize the elixir's effect.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
By the way, how did we wind up

in this situation, again?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Mai","
What was that?

Did Master give us a call?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Yes, she's summoned us.
We're probably in for a scolding.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
This mountain doesn't just belong to

you tengu, you know.
So that's your way of doin' things, huh? Decidin'

all by yourselves to scrap our non-aggression treaty?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
In that case, I'll give ya a warm welcome

with my way of doin' things.
A yamanba's way, that is!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Let's pause for a moment.
I bear no ill will of

any kind towards you.
We respect the independent and naturalistic

way of life that yamanba follow.
I simply came here because I wish

to ask you a few questions...

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Ah hah hah!

You tengu sure are a crafty lot, after all!
You come in an' threaten someone with force, an' then

have the gall to say ""I just want to ask some questions?""
I like you!

I'll accept any interview or whatever you've got.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Thank you ever so much.
I knew all along that your species

is actually quite friendly.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
So, what's this interview about?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Have you noticed anything in particular

about this year's autumn?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Ehh... is there somethin' goin' on?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I only wanted to interview the two of you

about the four seasons incident, but...
It looks like I've got no choice but to fight.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
I didn't expect to have to do this

right here, of all places, but...
Behold! Feast your eyes on us two servants'

secret ceremony, the  ""Tengu-Odoshi""! (Tengu Frightening) 

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Hmph! You're all bark and no bite.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Wow, she's strong.

Sure didn't expect that.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
It seems that we underestimated her.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
There's no need for me to show

such hostility towards you.
All I want is information on the four

seasons incident. That's all.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
The season incident?

Nah, that's not our fault.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Huh?

Really?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
See, we can draw out a target's latent abilities to

an infinite extent by dancing behind their backs.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
We received orders to seek out potential

in people who are normally hidden...
And to drive away any youkai who serve as

impairments, such as tengu and the like.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
The season incident was caused by the fairies, sprites

and divine spirits who went berserk because of our dancing.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Jotting all this down...

So, to sum it all up:

Your superior ordered the two of you to grant

power to youkai in various places.
The fairies went berserk as a side effect of that,

which made nature become strange...
So you two are the culprit behind

the season incident, aren't you?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Sorry, hang on a second.
...Huh?

...Understood.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
You're mistaken.
The effects of your supercharged rampage

are merely spreading to your appearance.
You should get out of here before your

sense of self completely breaks down.
I'll tell those two to deactivate the

power at your back that they granted.
Your strength will safely weaken,

and your skin should soon return to normal.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
What d'you mean, ""power at my back?""

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
That season weaponry that's been

following you around. See?
Without its influence, your power would be

a mere shadow of what it is right now.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
What?!

This is my power!
You're just scared of the strongest fighter around, aren'tcha?

C'mon, let's just have a little fight!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Well, aren't you confident.
As a symbol of Jizo, I exist in this world to provide

salvation to all creatures in this era without Buddhas...
But fairies sure don't count.

'Tis a bitter shame! I'll see you in your next life!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
W-What's with this fairy?!

She actually packs a punch!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Total pushover.

I can feel power surging forth again and again~!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
I see... I did get the feeling that there was

more power dwelling in me than usual,
but it looks like you had that same

power within you too!
If we were both using performance enhancers for that fight,

then it figures that a fairy would be so powerful.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Nah, that's totally not it!

This is my own true strength, fair and square!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Well, to tell you the truth,

my magic allows me to control life.
Fairies are pure life energy, so if I really got serious,

I should've been able to completely nullify you...
But for some reason, it didn't work on you.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
What are you trying to say?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
In short, you're running on some power

other than that of mere fairies right now...
Wha?!

Uh, there's a door stuck to your back?!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
There's a what-now on my back?

...Waagh?!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","

The fairy vanished...!? It's like she got sucked
away somewhere when she touched her own back...
....
...Well, fairies aren't salvation targets anyway.

Nothin' to see here, nothin' to see here.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Where is this?

It's all dark and boring in here...

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
What the?!

Is this that fairy from earlier?
Wow. Guess that means she won against the jizo

girl back there, huh? What a surprise.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Who're you?

Why do you know who I am?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Huh?

...Was I just imagining that we met earlier?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Oh, Mai.

You're such a scatterbrain...
Like literally, what are we going to do

with a fairy. Come on.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I mean, I bet I could've won if

I'd really gotten serious...
It's just that if I use any more of my

power, I fear I might lose control of it.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
What, you a sore loser or somethin'?

Sooo laaaame!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Grhrhgh.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
A'ight, where am I

gonna head next?
I feel like I can't lose to ANYONE right now!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Well, if you're leaving the shrine,

I'll hardly be one to complain.
You should be careful, though. ""Temporary"" power

always has something else lurking behind it.
I've sensed an evil intent behind that power, and...

oh, she's already gone!
My goodness. She's in for a rough time.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Hm? Hey, you fairy over there.

What's up?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
So you're my next opponent, eh?!
Let's battle for the title of the strongest!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Pfffft!
Who do you even think is responsible for squirts

like you having that power in the first place?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
I'm brimming with power!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
My, what's going on?

I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I feel like taking this out for a spin on some fairies!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Ahahahaha!

You two have fun beating on each other, now.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Blech!

This is the worst.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
...They don't seem to be coming back.
Well, I've managed to find the culprit

responsible for the season incident, but...
A god of impairments, hm... I really do feel like

I've heard about one in tengu history before...

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Ehh, yeah, I did mess up...

But I don't think Master will get mad at us.
Our job is to drive tengu away, after all.

All we gotta do is shoot her down here.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Your job is to drive tengu away...?

What in the world are you two?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
I'm Mai Teireida.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
And I'm Satono Nishida.

We're twin douji who serve a god of impairments.
We're fundamentally the same type of being as you.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
A god of impairments...

I feel like I've heard that phrase before somewhere.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Yes, a god of impairments...

A god who works to impair things.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Our job is to behave the same way as tengu,

in order to drive tengu away!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Yes, that's right.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

Could you perhaps spare a moment?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Nuh-uh-uh. Nah. Nope.

We might have the same classification, but you're our mortal enemy!
I did imagine that a tengu might show

up, but geeze, what a surprise...!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
I'm brimming with power!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
My, what's going on?

I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I don't care who!

I want to try this power out on someone!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Ahaha, just in time.

This gal here is your opponent.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Ah...

Dang it, she ran off.
I'm interested in this new face too, though.

Could you lend me a moment of your time?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Sure!

Thanks for facing off with me!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Facing off?

You do mean for an interview, right?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Nope, not at all.

It seems like this blizzard is giving me strength...
So I'm gonna hurl all that strength at you!

Eat this, you damn dirty tengu!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
What a pointlessly belligerent attitude...
Not bad, if you ask me!

In fact, it's my favorite!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
All right, then. Let's proceed with the interview.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
...*sob sob*

'Kay.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
You said a moment ago that the blizzard was giving

you power. What exactly did you mean by that?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Sorry, but I'm not sure either.

I can feel a strange power flowing forth, or something...?
I'm not usually this eager to fight, either.

I want to live a nice, quiet life, if anything!
Also... my back feels kind of hot, I think.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
...Who was that girl carrying the bamboo

a moment ago? Do you know her?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Wha? A girl with bamboo?

Who are you talking about?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
The strange girl who was dancing

behind you before we fought.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
You're kidding! Sure, this is a pretty harsh blizzard,

but I could definitely tell if someone was dancing right behind me.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
...""Jizo statues have zero ability to

pay attention."" Noted.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
My back's felt hot for a while now, so I've turned around to see

what's the matter many times, but there hasn't been anyone there.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
If your back feels hot... you should go see a doctor.

Or maybe a mason would be better, in your case.
Hm?

Um, miss? There's a door stuck to your back?!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Huh?

Wow, talk about scary.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I see! That girl from before was possessing you

via your back and giving you power!
Perhaps she was hiding in the backs of

all the others I fought, too...
If you don't enter a tiger's lair, you can't catch its cubs!

Let's see... wow, there's a lot of room in here.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I've finally found a material witness!

With that, I'd like to begin our interview.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
What?!

The tengu from before?! How'd you get in here...?!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I went through the Jizo's back.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Ack. Guess I left the door open...?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Oh, Mai.

You're such a scatterbrain.
What were you even thinking, bringing a tengu in here?

We're never going to hear the end of this.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
So above the forests in the foothills, it's midsummer.
Even though it was autumn over at the mountain...

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
I've got way too much power!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Hey, you! Yes, you in the black over there.

Are you enjoying this summer day?
If you've got nothing else to do, come cool

me off with that stupid-big fan of yours!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
The seasons are strange, but the fairies'

excitement certainly is too.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
You don't seem related to the incident, so without

further ado, allow me to blow you into next week.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Woohoo! Let's fight, let's fight!

It's time for a midsummer war!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
I surrenderrrr.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Mm. I've gone and wasted my energy on something

that had nothing to do with the incident.
That said, though...

You're quite strong for a fairy.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
I've got way more power than I know what to do with.

I feel like I could even become the god of the new world right now!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
What beautiful cherry blossoms...
It seems that the shrine's been taken over

by berserk fairies and youkai, though.
Is Reimu out, I wonder?

She sure is laid-back.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
A tengu reporter?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
If you're here for one of your violent interviews,

I'll have to decline. Just leave right now, okay?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Huh?

Just who are you...?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I'm Komano the komainu,

this shrine's guardian god!
I chase away intruders while

the shrine maiden is out.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
A komainu, hm?

Was there really one of these around?
Well, that's fine.

I'd like to ask you a few questions?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Hello? I just said I'm

chasing away intruders.
If you intend to stay in this shrine

any longer, I'll give you no mercy!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
So, I'd like to ask you about

these abnormal cherry blossoms.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I don't agree with violeeence...

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Excuse me? You were trying to

violently chase me out just now.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Aw, fine.
So, the cherry blossoms, was it? Or was it

the berserk fairies you wanted to know about?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I'd like to know about anything out of the

ordinary that you've noticed, yes.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything

about what's going on.
Really, I've got nothing.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Is that so...?

Your expression does seem to say as much.
That yamanba from before didn't

have any information, either.
We've got an incident big enough to cover all of Gensokyo,

but absolutely no clues as to the ringleader...
This may be the work of someone far more insidious

and strategically-minded than I thought!
I can feel a once-in-a-thousand-years scoop coming on!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Woah, a tengu...?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I would have liked to ask those two

some more questions, but that aside...
This is quite the mysterious world we have here.
To think that a jizo's back would have

such a vast world inside of it...

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Ah hah hah!

How very interesting!
A tengu, in the Land of the Back Door!

Just what is this world coming to?
I'm a being meant to govern impairments,

just like tengu, but we belong in different places.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Just like tengu...?

What in the world are you?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
My name is Okina Matara.
I am the god of the back door,

a god of impairments,
a god of noh performance,

a god of outcasts, a god of stars...

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
That's a lot of titles.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Heh heh heh.

Well, a tengu such as yourself should already understand.
Understand the fact, of course, that no god could

possibly have so many divine natures at once...

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
...Meaning?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
You think I'm lying,
don't you?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Well, yes.
Or perhaps you're not lying, but I get the feeling

that you're concealing your true nature.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Well, I'm an absolute secret god.

This may very well be my true nature after all.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Impairments... a secret god...

Oh, I remember now!
Our ancestors, the people of impairments, split into two groups.

One settled in the mountains and became tengu.
The other hid behind buddhas, living in human settlements.

That is to say, a secret god of impairments...
Could you be...?!

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
How many times must I say it?

I am that very god.
I have a wide variety of titles, but which one

do you think most accurately represents my true form?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Didn't you say just a moment ago

that your true form was that of a ""secret god?""

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
""A god of impairments"" also means

""a god of tengu-warding.""
That is to say, I am a god who

eliminates tengu from this world.
That's why I laughed at first.

A tengu, of all things, has entered the land of tengu-warding.
Such utter cheek that you crow of!

Be vanquished in earnest, you foolish tengu reporter! 

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
An insect fairy going berserk...

Well, I suppose the summer heat just got to her.
This doesn't seem big enough to write an article about.

Let's continue gathering material on the abnormal weather.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
What?

What's a tengu like you doin' here?
You're not s'posed t' be here. We made an agreement.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
Whoops, please excuse me.
This was your territory, yes?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
If you're sayin' you came in here already

knowing that, we're gonna have a problem.

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aya","
I came here to do a bit of journalism.
This spot appears to be the exact center of the autumn area,

so I would greatly appreciate it if I could ask you a few questions?

","Aya","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Youmu","
Coastal operations in Hell.

This is the first time I've seen it.


Someone real bad must've appeared......

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
(......)


(Hehehe...)

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah ha ha!

I can't stop laughing!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki,

we can finally act freely!


Excellent work! I see pretending to be used by Kicchou paid off.

Wolf spirit!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
......Yes!

You overpraise me, Lady Kurokoma.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
You are the strongest animal spirit......!

Just who are you?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
......This human doesn't know of me, huh.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma,

boss of the Keiga Family.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
The Keiga Family......?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
This person here's my boss.


The Keiga Family is an organization of animal spirits

who pride themselves over their strong arms, swift legs and infinite courage.


They're the strongest group in the Animal Realm, y'know.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
The strongest in the Animal Realm!?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Our brief deal with Kicchou in order to
defeat Keiki is now over.


Thanks to you defeating Keiki,

the Animal Realm has returned to being a competitive society.


And thus, the strongest, fastest army,

the Keiga Family, will rule all.


Soon the Animal Realm shall

come under our possession.


Perhaps not just the Animal Realm, but Hell and the Human Realm too......?

My dreams are broadening.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
In other words, since I defeated that god,

someone like you appeared in her place.


I have to take responsibility!


It's my duty to stop you,

even if it risks my life!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Heh heh, just what I like to hear.


Unlike that two-faced Kicchou,

you are determined and elegant.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
......

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Do you hear me? Wolf spirit,

you will do all you can to help this human and come at me!


It won't be fun if she's

not as strong as when she defeated Keiki.
Now, show this jet-black pegasus

the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
......*pant pant*


Your power, swiftness, bravery and knowledge

in facing down danmaku... All in perfect balance!


I-I'm moved!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
I can still fight!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
No, let's stop here.

If we keep going at it, one of us will fall.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
......*pant pant*, thank god.

I couldn't hold on anymore.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
Well, aren't you honest?
You've caught my eye.


By the way, you...

You're not a human from the surface, are you?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Yes, I'm a resident of the Netherworld.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
I see, the Netherworld.


Indeed, that would explain why

you were so good at manipulating the souls.


Yup, I've decided!

I'll try heading to the Netherworld next time.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Huh?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Saki","
If I can gain supporters in the Netherworld,

the Keiga Family would get even stronger!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Extra","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mokou","
Even if you roast me, I won't die.

It'll just be kind of hot... *sob*

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Well, then, let's roast her.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Extra","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
It looks to me more like
humankind learning how to add.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I wonder if non-humans have enough fingers

to even count up to ten.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I'm sure the island was
around here...
Could it be moving?
That aside...
It's the middle of summer.
Why's it so cold?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Cirno","
You'll never walk upon land again!

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
So you were the cold one.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Cirno","
Better than being hot, don't you think?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Gee, that was a cool pun.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Cirno","
No, I didn't mean...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
That's the best you can do, isn't it?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Ah, these short sleeves are bad for my body.
I should find a mansion that serves
tea soon.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Damn, gotta run for now!

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
See ya later.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Ah, thanks back there.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Long time no see.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Mai","
Well, you passed the test, sooo...
We hereby invite you

to meet the ultimate god hidden behind your back!



","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
So where exactly is she?

This hidden god of theirs?
And what is this world anyway?
It's just doors as far as the eye can see...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Komainu are... those things, right?

Those statues people always use as meet-up locations.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Well, yes, I suppose. Despite appearances,

I'm the guardian god of this shrine.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Ah hah hah!

Pretendin' to be an ally won't trick me!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Some guardian god you are!

The shrine's smack-dab in the middle of an incident right now!
I'm gonna beat you down and turn

the shrine's season back to normal!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I lost~!
I came here to do everything I could

for the shrine, but I got beaten up...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I didn't feel any aura comin' from you

that was related to the incident after all.
Well, uh, y'know.

Sorry.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I told you I was on the shrine's side

in the first place, didn't I?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
So, will you help me out with

my incident investigation?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Yes, certainly!
I've only been around the shrines and temples,

but the only things that were out of the ordinary...
Were the fairies going berserk?

Besides that, not much.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Those little squirts always freak

out during incidents, though.
Aside from that...
There's the fact that a komainu like you, who usually

does stuff in hiding, is out and about...
Now that I think about it, that does seem weird.
I guess I'll check out the last season's location

just to be safe, then draw my conclusion?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Good luck!

I'll be cheering you on from the shadows!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Let's table the cheering. It'll just throw me off.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Could you be one of the

chosen ones?
I was trying to be real flashy about all this,

but you still took way longer than I thought to show up.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Are you the one who did this to the forest?!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
I'm brimming with power!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Successors?

By 'two servants,' you mean those dancers from before, right?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Yes. They're my precious arms and legs, which is why

I periodically swap them out for new humans.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
So, what does the job normally entail?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I suppose you could say you'd be a fixer,

keeping the balance in Gensokyo from behind the scenes.
Well, it's an easy job.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I dunno if that's really that easy,

although it does sound interesting.
But I refuse!
I live my life doing

whatever I want.
If I had to live like those two just now?

Thanks, but no thanks.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Ah ha ha!

Aren't you misunderstanding something?
I never gave you a choice

from the outset.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
What?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I am the one who chooses my servants.

Certainly no one ever asked you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Hmph, so you're coming after me with brute force?

That suits me just fine!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
As long as you have that door of the seasons on your back,

any battle between us will be nothing more than a farce.
Now, let us begin the final test of darkness.

If you disappoint me, I'll kill you!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
My, what's going on?

I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I've just got to try this out

on the human in front of me!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Ahahahaha!

This gal here is your next opponent.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Hey! Get back here!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
I'm not quite sure why,

but it seems like this blizzard is giving me strength!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Hey... Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Oh, I remember now. You're Naruko the magic jizo, aren'tcha?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
I recognize that voice... Marisa, the magic human?
This magic blizzard is so bad that I could barely tell it was you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I'm chasing that girl who was just here,

so could you get outta my way?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
I don't want to.

I'm in the mood to test out my magic today!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Never thought I'd hear that from a shut-in introvert like you...

You really think you can beat me?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
With today's blizzard at my back,

I feel like I can take on anything!
That's my only reason, really!

Let's go!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
I've still got plenty of power!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Hold on, time out.
Isn't there something a bit off about your magic today?
How do I put this... like, the magic energy

is flowin' out in a really abnormal way.
It's comin' out from behind you.

You have to have noticed by now, right?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Oh, you're right...

It feels kind of like my back is on fire.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Gotcha. That bothers me too, but...

who was that person here earlier anyway?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
What person?

What are you talking about?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
The girl who was dancing behind you.

What, you didn't notice her?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
I thought I've always been alone, though?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Oh, right. You're the type who

likes your solitude an' all.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Ah, but still,

my back is just so hot...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
You ARE in a blizzard. Maybe it's frostbite?

Let me a have look.
Huh?

What the heck?!
You've got a door on your back!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Huh?

Wow, talk about scary.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Ah, I see you've arrived.
You're the human who my two servants mentioned, I see.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Yup, probably.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Hmm.
Why are you dressed like that?

Rather strange fashion sense you have.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
This here's a magician's uniform!

It's strange, sure, but for a magician it's a pretty good look.
And how about you, anyway?

Who exactly are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
My name is Okina Matara.
I am the god of the back door,

a god of impairments,
a god of noh performance,

a god of outcasts, a god of stars...
And I am one of the sages

who created our Gensokyo.
Sooner or later, I need to find some successors

to take over from those two servants of mine.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
What's the big idea here?!
It's freakin' HOT!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
What've we got here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Of course summer is hot.

Even fairies know that.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
I thought it wasn't gonna be this hot!

That's why I'm all bundled up like this.
Ugh, it's so hot I could just die!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Now that I look at you, you're totally dressed

for the wrong season. You look so dumb!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Come on! Get some exercise, and taste

this summer heat with your whole body!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
So hoooot!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Hot indeed!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
If it's so hot then why

are you dressed like that?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
It's so cold over where I live that it's snowing!

It's practically winter!
Seriously, what is going on?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
That sure is a good joke.

It's the height of summer right now.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Yeah, I can see that.

It's definitely summer 'round here.
Haven't had an incident this hard to get a hold of in a while.

I'm not even sure where to go investigate next.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
What?
This here's s'posedta' be my territory.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Huh, haven't seen you before.
Who are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
That oughta be my line.
I've always been livin' here.

Never moved an inch!
And all of a sudden, you came flyin' up.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
No doubt about it. All that energy

is coming from this door...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
What on Earth is happening to me?

Do something, Marisa!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Ugh... this is really obviously a trap, but...
Well, it's not like I can just ignore my only clue.

""Knock, and it shall be opened unto you!""

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
What's with this place...?
I can't believe there's such a big world

inside of Naruko's back.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
What the?!

How'd that human get in here...?
Ohhh. Guess I forgot to close that

jizo's back-door on my way out...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Oh, Mai.

You're such a scatterbrain.
You went and pulled a human in

before the order even arrived...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Eh, well! The tide should turn in our favor now, anyway.

I did a real spectacular job out there, after all.
If you ask me, Master's gonna say

""well done! This is perfect.""

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Who are you people?

And where is this place?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Heh! Why, I'm Mai Teireida.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
And I'm Satono Nishida.
Hello once again,
and welcome to the Land of the Back Door (Ushirodo-no-Kuni) .

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Land of the Back Door?

Never heard of it.
I figured that this was a trap,

but I can't back down now!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Don't worry,

this isn't a trap.
But we will be giving you a test now,

to see if you're one of the chosen ones.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Hmph. I dunno what the heck

that lady was on about...
But hey! A stronger enemy showed up,

so I'll just roll with that.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
This out-of-season blizzard
might make it hard to tell, but...
This is the Forest of Magic, you know?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
And?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
It doesn't matter who it is. There's nobody

who can stand up to a magic specialist like me!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
You moron!

You big ol' hat-headed moron!
Victory is decided by whoever's the strongest!
So victory is mine!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
I dunno! I'm just feeling really strong.
I bet it's because of

the midsummer sun.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Midsummer?
What're ya talkin' about?

It's midfall right now.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
""Midfall?""
Oh, you're right!

It's gotten cold all of a sudden!
W-What's going on?

It was definitely midsummer until noon...

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Are y'sure you're really

""Gensokyo overlord"" material...?
Welp, you just head along now,

lil' miss overlord.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Eh, whatever.

Now that it's cool out, I can REALLY show my true power!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Woah, the shrine's full of fall leaves!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Fall leaves?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Wow. You can't even tell the difference

between cherry petals and leaves.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Cherry petals?

Don't be stupid! It's fall, those would never...
Whaaa?!

They ARE cherry petals!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
What an idiot.

You sure have an impressive aura, though...

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
What the heck is all this?

This's awesome! It's only been one day...!
In just one day, it's turned from

midsummer to midfall to mid'sprin! 

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Um. ""Midfall"" and

""mid'sprin"" aren't words.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Huh? Really?
Whatever, though! Once I rule the land,

I'll make them into official words!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
You seem to be stronger than usual. I mean, so

are all the other fairies around here, but still.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Sorry, miss fairy, but I'm gonna

have to chase you outta here.
As this shrine's guardian beast!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
S-So strong...!
I knew that the fairies were stronger, but

I hardly imagined they were this strong...

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Yes! I'm one step closer to

becoming supreme overlord!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I'm the one keeping your power in check right now.

A fight between the two of us would be the very height of foolishness.
But... all right.

I'm interested in the power of fairies, too.
It might not be so bad to choose a fairy

for my subordinate once in a while.
Of course, that's only if you

prove your power to be worthy.
Unleash your power to its fullest strength!
And then show me!

Show me the noh of darkness that a fairy dances!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Wahooo!
Summer is the BEST!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Wahooo!

It sure is!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Oh my, you've got a tan!

Are you enjoying this fine summer day?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Heck yeah I am!

Summer is when I, the great ice fairy, can show my true power!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
We butterfly fairies are hardly going to lose either!

I'm surging with endless strength!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno & Larva","
LET'S FIGHT TO SEE WHO SUMMER BELONGS TO!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
I win!

Summer is officially mine!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
I lost~.

You sure are something!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Man, I've NEVER been this

powerful before!
I'm gonna charge onward and conquer Gensokyo!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Fight on for my share, too!

We're all counting on you!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Leave it to me!

I shall create the future of us fairies with my own two hands!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
What?
This here's s'posedta' be my territory.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Like I care!

I'm the fairy who shall soon lord over Gensokyo!
I can go anywhere and do

anything I want!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
An overlord, eh? Well, sure, have

fun with your lordin' or whatever.
More importantly, you oughta

git on outta here.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
BAH!

You're looking at me like I'm an idiot, aren't you?
In that case, I'll be taking forcible action!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Assertive little fairy, aren'tcha.
All right.

I'll cut ya open, just like ya asked!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Are you seriously a fairy?

You've sure got some guts!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
I mean, I was expecting the magic jizo

what's-her-name to get chosen.
Looks like we've got an unforeseen outcome on our hands!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
What are you two babbling about?
I'm always ready to rumble, you know!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Unexpected stuff is the best spice of life.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Oh, Mai, Mai, Mai. That attitude is what

always lands you up the creek, you know?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Aw, c'mon. An unforeseen fairy got chosen!

Isn't that okay too?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
If she's got the power to back it up, of course...
Which means it's time for a test!

Show us what you're really made of!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Okay, who's gonna fight me first?

Decide quick!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Unexpected stuff is the best spice of life.

Don't you think so too?
Be overjoyed, O little warrior tribesman!

Your opponent shall be both of us at once!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Y-You still wanna go?!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Yeah, that oughta be fine.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
My, that was actually all right.

By fairy standards... However...

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Sorry, but you don't pass.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Whaaat?!

Are you makin' fun of me?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
In the end, you were only fighting

with the power that we gave you.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Your original power is hardly

anything worth noting.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
What are you two babbling about now?
I won, didn't I? Plain as day!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
That was a test, is the thing.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
You're only being strengthened by

our powers, right now.
We were just pretending to put up a fight

so that we could gauge your original strength.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Quit MESSING with me!

Are you two sayin' you did somethin' to my power?!
Aha! Now I see!

The truth is that I'm even more powerful than this!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Sorry, hang on a second.
...Huh?

...Understood.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
What was that?

Did Master give us a call?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Yes, she's summoned us.
We're probably in for a scolding.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Blech!

This is the worst.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
She said to hang on for one second,

but they just up and left.
...Err. Uhhh?

What am I supposed to do now?
Plus, those two kind of seemed like

they weren't even paying attention to me...
.....
Perfect!

This means I've got a free pass to smash this place up!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Where did those two weirdos

run off to, anyway?
Aside from that, though,

this place is so dark and boring.
I'm gonna leave.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
What are you doing here?
What on Earth are those two layabouts doing?

There's some weird fairy wandering around in here.

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Who the heck are you?!

You seem real strong!
Come, do battle with me!

We'll fight for the title of the strongest!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Have you not noticed yet?
Even if you're a fairy, if you run rampant any more

than this, you won't be able to hold yourself together.
Look, your skin is browning as we speak.

Isn't that proof enough?

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Cirno","
Whaat?! This is just a tan!

It's a summer medal of honor!

","Cirno","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Meiling","
Hey, since when have we
known each otherrrr.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Since just before, remember?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
Hmm. I did run into some weirdo,
didn't I.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Whatever, you're in the way.
Aren't you the guard around here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
You know, a guard's job is to get in the way.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
So you are the guard, after all?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
No, I'm just a normal person who happens to be guarding.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
So then you're a normal person.
Then I'll punish you right here.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
What kind of an education did you have?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Just as I thought, fighting
normal people doesn't suit me.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
That had to be a lie...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Whoa, so many books.
I'll take some on my way out later.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Don't carry them off...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I'm gonna carry 'em off.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Let's see... How to take out the black thing in front of me
without having to do anything...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
(That is actually written in there?)

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Hmm, my eyes have gotten worse lately.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Isn't that because the room is so dark?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Perhaps I have an iron deficiency.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
If anything, it's vitamin A.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
How about you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I have enough. Of a lot of things.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Your time, too, is mine...
An old-fashioned witch doesn't stand a chance.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Aah, I'm tired.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Then why don't you go home?
I have a job to do.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
All right, I will.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Really?
Bye.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Can I become the chief maid
without actually being a maid?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Then maybe I'll help myself.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I'm really tasty.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Let's see... How to easily remove
the impurities from my ingredients...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Seems like magic's your thing.
Anything else you got up your sleeves?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
(sob sob) I can't finish reciting
the spells because of my anemia.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Ah, the cleaning isn't getting anywhere!
The mistress will be angry with me!!

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
You're getting in the way of my cleaning again...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Oh dear, a maid.
I'll be arrested under the Washington Convention
if I catch you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Ah, magicians are actually
in greater need of mercy. 

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Have mercy.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
So?
Were you also hired to
work here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Ah, that sounds like it could be nice.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
But you don't look like you
could even clean.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I can't.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Then, what will you be in charge of?
Love duties?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
More like building repairs.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
That's silly.
We're not in elementary school anymore.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
So love duty belongs in junior high?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Well then, I'll have you
start working immediately.
I forgot to introduce myself.
I am Sakuya, the chief maid.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
So if I beat you,
I become chief maid, right?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
More people have said that and been killed by me
than there are thorium decay products.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Ah. That must happen
a lot, then.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Of course you can't.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
We don't see people like you around here often.
There's nothing here, okay?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Right back atcha.
Are you really even a maid?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
There's definitely something here.
This eerie atmosphere is giving me the chills.
Why do the strong ones always hide?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
A skilled hawk does not hide...
 its tail.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
...You don't seem to have skills or brains.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Humans are the only ones
who need simple chemical
thought centers such as brains.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
You're one of those, right?
Can't stand sunlight or smelly vegetables,
or silver things.
The masters of the night,
which for some reason have tons of weaknesses...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Yes, I am indeed a sickly girl.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Seems interesting. So you really drink it?
You know, that.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Of course I do.
But I'm a light eater, so I always leave some.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
How many people's blood
have you sucked up until now?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Can you remember how many slices

of bread you have eaten until now?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Thirteen.
I prefer Japanese food.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
So, what are you here for?
I'm already quite full, but...

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I see. Well, I'm hungry.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
...Help yourself, then.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Ah, is that so.
Just now, that was the name of a flower:
""aas?kai.""

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Humans are such fun.
Or maybe you're
not a human?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
I'm a fun human.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Fufufu. Is it because the moon is so red?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia_and_Marisa","
It looks like it's going to be a hot night.
Looks like it's gonna be a cold night.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
This kinda feeling, it's...
Knowing her, she'd probably say,
""It sure feels great out"".
I hate the night, though.
There's only weirdos around at this hour.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Who are you calling a weirdo?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
Nobody said anything about you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Rumia","
Um, no, of course not.

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Marisa","
So, why are you stretching out your arms like that?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Rumia","
Doesn't it remind you of
a saint crucified on a cross?

","Marisa","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Seiran","
Now proceeding with purification.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
What's up with you?
Who are you talking to?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
I have no need to answer.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Because shortly, I will
exterminate you!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Man,
earthlings sure are strong...

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
I really was in bad luck
when I lost that rock-paper-scissors game.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
If you're saying ""earthlings"", that means...
You're a Moon rabbit, aren't you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
That's right.
I've received an order to purify Earth.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Ah, I see, that's why Eirin
asked us to do this.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
For some reason, the fairies' attacks
are more violent than usual.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Guess I shoulda just listened to
what Eirin said after all.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
I've been waiting for you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
I heard about you from Seiran.
She said she'd engaged an interesting person...

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
You're a Moon rabbit too?
Eirin told me that someone
is attacking us from the Moon.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Guess so.
But we're not exactly here to attack you.
Rather, we're here to purify.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Well, whatever.
I should finish my job and take a breather.
Earthlings, who are allowed to get hit,
cannot possibly understand our hard work?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Oh, you're strong.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Woah, that was intense all of a sudden.
I'm not lookin' forward to what's up next.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
What are you going to do now?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...it's still too early to speak.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
A'ight. If you won't talk,
I'll be the first to move.
That look on your face
seems like you know what's up.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
I now understand why
you were sent here.
I'm sure it was on Lady Yagokoro's suggestion.
You're terribly strong.
Perhaps with you...

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
So you can talk after all, huh?
Are you the one who's orderin'
the attack on Gensokyo?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
Yes, I am.
The Gensokyo Capital Relocation Plan
was meant only as insurance, though.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Wait, relocation?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
We're better off not
doing it, mind you.
Though it's not as if we can keep the
Lunar Capital frozen like this forever...
Well, it can't really be helped.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
I really don't get what yer talkin' about.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
The Lunar Capital is what's
really under attack.
Via a method that renders us People of
the Moon unable to act, to boot.
I was considering migrating to Gensokyo
to prevent us from being wiped out.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
The Lunar Capital's under attack?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
Yes, that is the case.
The People of the Moon aren't aware
of any of this, though.
I am a being who can change the
world's course with my words.
When that rumor began to spread, the Lunar Capital
would materialize there, and the danger would be avoided.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
I kinda get it, but kinda don't.
But just keep Gensokyo outta this, okay?
'S a pain.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Hm, better keep my fingers crossed then.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
It's because I cross my fingers for you
that humans can live in peace.
The mountain is no place for mortals.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
There sure are strange people at the foot of the mountain.
So, are you going to punish me, as well?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
I sure am.
You look like an evil god to me.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
Well, that's okay.
Why don't I do the punishing, instead?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
What are you talking about? I'm punishing you.
Who are you going to punish?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
Why, you, of course.
I'll punish you with the power of a living god...
With the divine power to cause miracles!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
You're strong...
Your ""anything goes shop"" act really threw me.
Are you really some sort of hero?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
I told you, we're an anything-goes shop.
The tengu and the kappa were getting sick of you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
All I wanted was for people to revere this mountain
in the name of Lady Yasaka, the goddess of mountains.
I thought that the humans and youkai that lived here
would like that...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
They don't, so go on,
take me to the last boss.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
What!?
Do you mean to meet with Lady Yasaka?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
You've got to scold a god when they act up.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Who'd have thought there'd be such a huge lake on top of the mountain?
Come on out,
You oblivious god!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Who doth call for mine presence?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Is it you? That god who acts like the mountain's hers,
and that's trying to take over the shrine at the foot of the mountain?
I came to punish you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
......
Heh, how interesting.
Gensokyo's humans sure are peculiar.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
So, you see, if you don't try hard to get along with
the tengu and kappa that live in the mountain?
Somebody'll get in trouble!
For sure.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
The mountain itself is me.
The mountain is the object of worship of me.
After all, this is the only such magnificent
mountain in all of Gensokyo...
I can't help it if those who live here
don't have faith in me.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Oh, thinking about leaving Gensokyo?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Oh, but it's just starting to get good.
Stay out of my way.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
Every disaster will befall you.
I can't let you pass, even to protect humans!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
Oof...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
""...after the light skirmish involving danmaku exchanges...""
What comes after this, again?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
I don't understand what you're saying.
Wanting to go to the mountain... are you really human?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
How I'd like a drink...
Well, anyway, only humans would memorise pi.
Therefore, I'm human.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Ack, a human!?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Huh?
She ran away.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Awww, my optical camouflage suit broke!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
You mean, I broke it.
Who are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
You're a human, but you picked me out pretty well from the camo.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
You weren't hidden at all.
You really stood out.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
See you, human!
By the way, it's dangerous if you go any further?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Listen when people talk to you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Hey, it's that human from before.
Didn't I tell you not to go any deeper?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Aw geez.
Are all the youkai in the mountain like you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Sorry about that, it's just been
so long since I've actually seen a human.
I just wanted to give my new
optical camouflage suit a test run.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
You want to make me a test subject? What an honour.
Please, perform your experiments on me.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Well, anyway, the mountain gets dangerous from
here in, so I thought I'd chase you away.
Let me tell you straight up...
Turn back now.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Saying that just makes me want to go on all the more.
Doesn't a big ""KEEP OUT"" sign just
make you want to see what's behind it?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
No, it doesn't.
It doesn't, so just go home.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Kanako","
A god must eliminate all who oppose
their struggle for faith, one by one.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Why are you so worried about
faith all the time?
Gensokyo doesn't need any gods these days.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Kanako","
Were Gensokyo to completely lose its faith, surely
it would be thrown into chaos.
The faithless can never
understand the meaning of faith.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
I have orders from the boss
not to let you pass.
Belonging to a group means that sometimes,
you don't get to have your way.
Now, I'll go easy on you,
so come at me with all your might!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Hey, no need to talk about going easy on me.
Can't you just lose the game by default?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Hardly ever have I had a serious match,
and you were stronger than I expected.
With that power, maybe you could even beat that pain of a god.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Don't worry, I'll take care of her for you.
But what is that god doing that's gotten all
you tengu and kappa to hate her so much?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
...Kappa?
You heard it from a kappa, didn't you?
To put it simply, she acts like the mountain is hers, which
is a pain to those of us who've been here all this while.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
What are you talking about? Aren't you tengu the ones
who just decided the mountain theirs?
Humans don't go near the mountain thanks to you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Even so, can't the newcomer
at least show us some respect?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Yeah, maybe. Well, whatever. Now,
time to take me to where she is.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
What's the meaning of you storming into my shrine like this!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
A shrine!?  On top of the mountain?
Well, I guess it's got that atmosphere...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
I go to a shrine every day, you know.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Kanako","
A shrine that loses its faith is nothing but a simple shack.
Now, you, who goes to
such a shack every day?
Experience this once the raging soul of a god!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Seems like everyone's just trying to chase me away.
If that's how it is, I'll keep on going as far as I can.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
S-strong... 
To think I'd lose to someone like you...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Now, 
up the mountain I go.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
You're an energetic human. Kappa and humans have been sworn friends 
since ancient times, so let me tell you something.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
For the loser to claim to be a sworn friend 
is a little strange.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
Recently, a threatening god has taken up residence at the top of the mountain.
Thanks to that, us kappa and tengu 
have been bothered.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
What are you saying? 
You want me to go solve it?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
Ah, I've said too much, 
don't worry about it.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Hmm. From this waterfall 
the game is on!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Ayayayaya...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
I came to check on that intruder report,
but I never thought it'd be you...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Oh, hey, it's the tengu from back then.
Perfect timing.  Won't you show me the way in?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Too bad for you, I came to chase the intruder away.
I wonder where you wanted me to take you anyway.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
I've heard a rumor. A strange god came to live on
top of the mountain, right?
I'm the hero that's come to beat her.
I'm the hero, going forth with a bang.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Ho, I wonder who you heard that from?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Hm, I wonder, I already forgot who it was...
Anyway, I want to go see that god.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Heheh,
I'd love to let you have your way...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
But there's no way I can let you through.
The tengu patrollers won't stand for it
if I let you through that easily.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Why not?
It'll be fine, I won't bother those tengu.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
This is the Moriya Shrine,
a long-forgotten shrine of the past.
It was moved into Gensokyo from the outside world
together with the lake.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Who are you?
Wait... are you a shrine maiden?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
I'm Sanae, a wind priestess, descendent of a
long-forgotten line of gods incarnate in the outside world. 
Well, I guess you could call me something like a shrine maiden.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Oh, so ""shrine maiden"" is actually the name of a job...
I almost thought it meant ""Reimu"".

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
So then, who are you?
You don't look like a pilgrim to the shrine...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
I'm the magician, Marisa.
I'm the hero at the foot of the mountain, come to beat up the evil god.
We also take care of kappa and tengu.
We're an anything-goes kind of shop.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Aw, man...
It's been a while, so I'm out of shape. I could use some practice.
Sure would be nice if someone strong would show up...

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
You say that as if it were nothing at all.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
But you're a human, and humans are supposed to be afraid of youkai!

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
I'm afraid of other things, too.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Minoriko","
Where you're trying to go, the youkai are
very different from those you've seen before.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
That sounds like fun.
So, you're stronger than a youkai, right?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Is that so?
Even so, it seems that you hold some tiny spring of your own.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
Well, perhaps I shall partake of your small spring as well?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Have winters always been this busy?
Normal humans usually stay indoors.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
You mustn't consider me a normal human.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Are you a weird human, then?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
I'm normal, just not human!!

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
This barrier is amazing.
There's no way a novice like me can solve its mystery.
Is there something I'm missing?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lyrica","
Eh, heh, heh?.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lyrica","
It's a trade secret.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Au pas, camarade...

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lyrica","
That isn't going to work, kid.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Fine, then.  So who are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lyrica","
It doesn't matter, does it?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sagume","
You need not concern yourself.
Now that I've gone and talked about it,
fate will begin to change again.
The relocation will surely not come to be.
Thus, I'll place my bet on you.
There's no escape any more.
Fate has at last begun to reverse.
Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Kyahahahaha!
Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies!
Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic tiiiime!
Welcome to a world of madness!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Let's review what we have so far.
The Lunar Capital's been put in stasis.
Either the lady from before or someone else
did that for defense purposes...
Also, she said that there's someone else
invading the Lunar Capital too.
An' they're using ""a method that prevents
the moon's people from acting""...
So they're using me to save
the Lunar Capital, I guess?
In summary, it looks like Eirin's (she's)  been
takin' me for a ride since the start...

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
You got past all the fairies
bathed in my torchlight.
You must really be something.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Who're you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
I'm a fairy from hell,
Clownpiece!
You're the first visitor we've had
since honorable friend gave us this land!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
A fairy...? Hah, can't believe those moon people
would have their hands full with these guys.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Hm, you're not afraid of me?
Oh, right.
Honorable friend told me something.
""If anyone comes from the Lunar
Capital, do anything you want to them!""

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Well, I get that you're the ""enemy""
the moon people were talkin' about.
Better beat you quickly and report this, huh?
Saving the Lunar Capital oughta
save Gensokyo too, after all.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Hmmm~.
Am I really not that scary?
Nah, no way. The moon's people
should all be scared of my presence.
Well, it's fine by me either way.
Be sullied with impurity and fall to hell!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Hah, hah, hah...
W-why...?
But I heard that as long as we fairies,
symbols of life, controlled this place,
the people of the moon wouldn't
be able to do a thing!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Well, y'see.
That's probably because I'm not from the moon.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Wait, lady...
uh, I mean, madam? You're an earthling!?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Yup.
Been squatting on the earth as long as I lived.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
What's an earthling doing here...?
Nobody told me this would happen.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
By the way, I don't get why the moon's people
can't do anythin' against of you fairies.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
That's because the moon's people reject life and death.
Being born and dying
both mean becoming impure.
As lumps of life energy, the moon's people
wouldn't even think of touching us.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
But don't all humans die?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Of course, they usually don't
reject it completely,
but now our life energy has been refined
thanks to the power of our honorable friend.
Wouldn't it be awful to get totally impure just
by touching us? For the moon's people, I mean.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
...I still don't totally get it,
but you at least don't seem like the true
culprits behind the Lunar Capital invasion.
It's clear that someone's
using you behind the scenes.
...much like m'self, really.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
No matter how many countermeasures
I work out, you overcome them.
'Tis a shame.
My nemesis was nearly within reach.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
What are you...?
That's some power you've got. It's not magic;
it's some force I've never sensed before.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
For not one moment did I ever expect
that they would send an earthling to the moon.
And you've even reached here without even a single mistake.
For now, I shall admit defeat.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
What do you mean?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
I'm surprised that the people of the moon, hating even the
slightest impurity, would use such a haphazard method.
I underestimated them.
It seems the battle has already been decided...

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Don't really get what you mean,
but it's great that I've won!
Yep. Real great.
--okay, you're pissin' me off somehow!
What exactly are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Not sure why, but I guess the rule
was that you lose once I get here, huh?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
That's true.
However...
Since you've managed to come here,
I humbly challenge you to a duel.
It is only polite, is it not?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Augh, dammit!
You sayin' I was nothin' but Eirin's pawn
since the start!? Fer' god's sakes!
I've got nowhere to vent this anger.
I'll just hafta take it all out on you!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Yes, anger is the only force driving me as well.
Even if we are unable to dwell together under Heaven,
my hatred alone will be refined.
Now, show me!
Just what an earthling risking her life is capable of!
And behold!
This pristine spiritual force that rejects life and death!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
No matter how many countermeasures
I work out, you overcome them.
However, it seems your foolish
scheme has ended in failure.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
What are you...?
That's some power you've got. It's not magic;
it's some force I've never sensed before.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Indeed.
It is a pristine force, one that the likes of you humans would never have.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Aha, sounds real interesting.
I'll have you show me that power!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
The people of the moon escape into a dream,
and send an earthling to deal with me.
I thought it to be a daring plan,
but I suppose I overestimated them.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
What'd you say?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
A human so completely surrounded by the stench of death
can never hope to defeat me.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
My name is Junko.
With my power of purification,
I am able to kill you unconditionally.
Just how many mistakes have you made
before reaching here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
I didn't make no mistakes!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Allow me to count that petty lie
as one mistake as well.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Yeah, okay, that was a lie.
The enemies this time are way too strong, anyway!
Of course I'd make a couple mistakes here an' there!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
The moon's people, too, have committed a foolish mistake.
It seems this earthling is far
more weak than you all thought.
My stagnated engagement with the people of the moon
was just beginning to exhaust my interest.
My mortal enemy, Chang'e. Are you watching!?
Look at the numerous lives and deaths, the impurities, this poor soul brings!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Huh?
What d'you mean by that?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Well, the Earth is going
to be purified soon...

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
I'm thinkin' I'll just go stop the
Lunar Capital's aggression.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
If you're that strong,
you might as well go there.
To the crazed Pure Land,
the Lunar Capital(Lunatic Kingdom).

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
I was at the lake just a while ago...
What is this place?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Oh, my.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
The magician from Gensokyo, hm?
What dream will you be having toda...
Wait, your physical body!?
Is that your physical body!?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
I think it still is.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
For your physical body to break into
the Dream World like this...
...have you been caught in some kind of trap?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Trap?
Aw, so that really was a trap.
Even though there's a giant moon
right in front of me, too!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
Are you seeing the Moon?
Oh-ho, I see now.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
Very well.
I will dispose of this lunatic dream.
Now, sleep.
I will craft your Kaian now.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
My, my, aren't you going to sleep?
In that case, you'll stay in a dream
no matter how much time passes.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Hm-m, so I'm inside of a dream right now?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
That's right.
Your physical body is inside of a dream.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
What the heck happened to the whole
'going to the Lunar Capital' thing...?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
It seems that your dream is indeed
headed to the Lunar Capital.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
And, you are
soon about to arrive.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Huh.
That's alright then.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
However, I cannot recommend that you
remain within that nightmare.
Dreams invade your mind more than reality itself.
Dreams used unnaturally are extremely dangerous.
It would be better for your mind if you kept
seeing dreams about school legends, as you did before.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Wha...?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
The dreams are becoming real.
You must have sensed it, surely?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
With the urban legends(Occult Balls), that is.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Is this... the Lunar Capital?
Weird. There's barely anythin'
alive around here.
Besides the lady from a minute ago.
Maybe I'm still in a
dream or something...

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
......

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Speak of the devil.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...ah, a human?
......

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
Not very friendly, are ya?
I'm a human who came here from Earth!
Can't ya be a little more surprised?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
......

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Marisa","
What exactly are ya tryin'
to do in Gensokyo?
Why isn't there anyone here
in the Capital except you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Minoriko","
I'm just one amongst the multitudes of gods.
There are many more here just like me.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Just more of the same after all, huh?
Guess I can't expect much.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
If I have to keep fighting like this,
I'll never make it to the mountain.
I could recite all the digits of pi before I got there.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Oh, are you still here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
""How I like a drink, alcoholic of course,
after the light skirmish involving danmaku exchanges."" 

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Is that some sort of spell?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Marisa","
Ah, a new face.
Who're you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
I'm sure we've met before, but I'm
just here to gather misfortune, now.

","Marisa","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Satono","
Now, if you're too weak, our

Master will get real mad at us...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
So you'd better give us all you've got!

If you die, welp, that's the end of that!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
We're not gonna hold anything back,

but if you go and die on us, you're totally dead meat!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
You're not half-bad!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Oh, sorry about that.

I'm Marisa the magician.
I'm not sure why, but it seems like the season around

this one area has turned into autumn?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
I don't know nothin' 'bout that.

More importantly, you should git outta here.
If you stick around here any longer,

I'll slice you open an' sun-dry you!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Whew, you're strong.

Y'said you were a magician?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Yes. Although a human one,

admittedly.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Oho. A human, eh?
As humans go, you remind me a' that

legendary Kintoki kid.
I like you!

I'll hear any questions y'got.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Really? Okay, then.
Do you know anything about the one who made it into

autumn just around this one area?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
""Just this one area?""

The heck y'mean by that?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Are you aware that there's abnormal weather

occurring in various places in Gensokyo?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Nah.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Could you please tell me any other places

where there's been strange weather.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
I ain't never left here,

so I dunno nothin'.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
...Sorry to have bothered you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
The shrine's pretty weird, too. This is the

only place with so many cherry trees blooming.
Although, I can't imagine the culprit of an incident

would be hanging around at the shrine...

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Oh, miss Marisa! Hello!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Miss Reimu is out at the moment.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Who the heck are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Oh, don't be like that!

I'm Komano the komainu!
Although this is our first time talking.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Is it, now.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I may not look it, but I've been quietly protecting

shrines and temples for quite some time now!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Okaay! That's good enough.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
You did all right. Passing marks, I guess?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Alright, congrats!

You paaaaassed!

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
P-pass? Pass what?

What's this all about?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
See, we can draw out a target's latent abilities to

an unlimited extent by dancing behind their backs.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
We received orders to seek out potential

in people who are normally hidden...
And we're looking for especially

aggressive talent like you.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Drawing out latent abilities... Ah-hah.

So that's what the door on Naruko's back was doing?
Wait, so are the four seasons going crazy

because you're drawing out the latent potential of the fairies?

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Well, it's more like a side effect.

The fairies are just going crazy on their own.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
You want someone talented so badly that you're willing

to let the fairies throw Gensokyo into chaos...
An' that someone is me, eh?

I see, I see.

","Marisa","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Some new faces I'm seeing
running around here.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
It's inevitable,
I'm attacking!

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
This is Seiran.
I've made contact with a belligerent earthling.

","Marisa","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Chimata.
I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
What?
Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah!
It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
By which you mean?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I always knew that she was taking
advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize
that I was taking advantage of her right back!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Oho.
How very interesting.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
You're Iizunamaru's pet, aren't you?
Trot on back and tell her.
The market is already open.
None can escape from the hands of God!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Helloooo?
You've been talking for way too long!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot.
Well then, shall we begin?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Huh? Begin what?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
What do you mean, ""what""...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've
spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Sell them?
No way!
I'm here to investigate the cards.
I'm thinking that once I figure out what
they really are, I'll confiscate them all.
I'll never get a good night's sleep
with these cards making the rounds!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I see...
You're trying to monopolize the cards with no exchange of currency.
So, you were a robber seeking to destroy the marketplace?
I certainly can't let that slide.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Good, the rain's stopped.
Now my investigation can really get underway.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Hey, Sis!
Yeah, you over there!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
I've got some nice cards!
Wanna buy any?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Cards?!
Looks like I've found my first clue already.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Ooh, looks like I've got a bite.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
It's dangerous to have those.
Hand them over right now!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Whaa?
Are you sayin' you're gonna steal 'em by force?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Exactly!
Those Ability Cards are the subject of my incident investigation.
Quit making excuses and hand them over!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Ggh...!
There's no point in attacking me!
But you won't be getting any Ability Cards
through violence, that's for sure.
I need somethin' of value in return, right?
That's the basis of the entire free market.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Alright, alright, I'll buy them like I'm supposed to.
So, how much do they run for?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
...Heh heh heh.
Now we're talking.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
There's no telling what could be
lurking this deep in the mountains...
Are there really any merchants
hanging out in a place like this?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Oh! Now that I get a good look at you,
you're the Hakurei shrine maiden!
It's rare to see you this far off the beaten path.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
You're... not a kappa.
You're a yamawaro, right?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Indeed! And as you may be aware, this
cliff's a secret hideout for us yamawaro.
It's no place for humans to be skulking around.
So get outta here, quick!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Hang on! Those are Ability
Cards you're holding, right?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Cards, eh...?
I guess you've been sniffing around for them after all.
Better dispose of you before
you raise too much of a ruckus!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Good grief, you're strong...
But it's too bad for you!
Cards can't be taken through violence.
Those are the rules.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Man, it's gross in here.
So, oh otter spirit possessing me,
where's the enemy we're searching for?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Otter)","
(....)
(This was always the most beautiful
garden in the entire Animal Realm...)
(I'd heard the rumors, sure,
but this really is atrocious.)

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact
that nobody was left to fight against us...

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Otter)","
There you are!
The god of destruction who defies the law of beasts!
Keiki Haniyasushin!
The time has come for your ambitions to be crushed!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Oh, that's good to hear. Animals ought
to be nice and lively, after all!
I can smell that particular fishy scent
of the Kiketsu family coming off of you.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Otter)","
...?!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
But you look like a human, though...

Just what kind of cowardly scheme did you come up with?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Whoa, whoa, wait!
I'm human!
Who are you?
And what is this place?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
All the stones we were stacking fell over

because you were thrashing around!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Oh, I'm so sorry.

I didn't notice them.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
The stone-stacking contest is ruined now...

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
You won't be thrashing around any more

once I'm through with you!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
Gugugu... So strong...

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Sorry about that.

I'm really just passing by.
I have no interest in you.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
...?!
I see... you possessed a human.
But what exactly do you
hope to accomplish,
by tricking and dragging along some foolish human who doesn't

know anything? Kiketsu family's... otter spirit, I believe?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Otter)","
(...She's not afraid of live humans?!)
(Lady Kichooou!
This isn't what you said would happen!)

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Heh heh heh.
You there, human.
Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
I am the sculptor god(Idola Deus) who protects the
human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other.
Don't you agree?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
F-fellow humans...?!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Otter)","
Don't be fooled, shrine maiden!
She's a wicked god who only sucks up
faith from the human spirits!
She's an enemy of beasts and humans both!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
U-urgh...
I feel like I've gotten dragged into something really obnoxious.
But I can see an evil aura around you!
I'll beat you for starters, and then think things over!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Ah. Your intuition certainly isn't very sharp.
I'm saying that I'll let you off the hook if you
back off now, but you didn't notice at all...
What a shame.
What a crying shame...

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Otter)","
(Human, this is bad!
We let her stall for too long!)

Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Otter)","
We must retreat for now!
RUN!

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

There's no treasure, right?
What a letdown.

Well, I guess I have to go see
what this ship really is.

It doesn't look like I'll get anything for it, though.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Yeah.
Okay, there's nothing inside the ship.


It'll be good to be done with this investigation.
It's so boring.


I mean, all that's happening is
the ship's just flying around.


If it's not a treasure ship, there's no point to it.
It's just a box.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Is someone there?

A human ... ...?
Or have you also given up your humanity?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hmph, It looks like I missed something.
There's a youkai!  I'll have to beat you!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
I see, you're human, right?


Then you'd better just put down those treasures
and leave this ship immediately.


We'll be reaching our destination soon.
There won't be any going back then.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Destination?
Who are you, anyway ...?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Oh, where are my manners?
I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Captain?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
This ship will be leaving this land
to go to another world, where Hijiri is sealed away.

There, we'll revive Hijiri,
and everyone will be able to forget their troubles.


We'll make a paradise where no-one can brush us aside ... 
We'll make a liberating future where we can use our powers freely ...


That paradise is this ship's destination.
That's the ideal Hijiri has sought.


So, anyone with any lingering connection to this world
should disembark; what will you do?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I don't understand what you're saying, but ...


I understand this isn't a treasure ship now.


It's a devils' nest where youkai hide out, isn't it?
I can't overlook this.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
If you can't overlook it ...?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Then I'll just have to beat the captain
and drop this ship out of the sky.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
I forgot to mention this, but we absolutely need that treasure
in order to go to the other world.


The mysterious flying objects that you have
are fragments of that treasure.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
You mean you're trying to get all these?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
So, I was hoping you'd co-operate with us, but ...
Too bad.


It looks like letting you on puts us in danger of sinking.
Fall out of this ship and bathe in the cursed oceans!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
This power's buried a lot of youkai, hasn't it?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
That's right!
So stop doing bad things!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
But we're not doing anything bad.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Of course you are, you're a youkai, right?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
I can't just stop being a youkai~

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hm, this ship really isn't stopping, is it?
Even though the captain isn't doing anything ...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
It's in auto-mode.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Now that I know this isn't a treasure ship,
I'm not that interested.


Now I finally know what this ship really is.


But I still have to find out where it's going!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
This ship looks pretty bleak, though.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
I regret to have to tell you there's no treasure left.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What was that?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
There she is.
You're the person the youkai were trying to ... ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Oh, didn't you break the seal?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, uh,
I guess that's the way it turned out, but ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Thank you very much.


I never dreamed I'd be able
to bathe in the light again like this.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
So, who are you?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
My name is Byakuren.


I was a monk a long, long time ago.


You seem to be a shrine maiden, am I right?


Did you come down here
to admit that I wasn't wrong?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hm.
I'm a shrine maiden who punishes those who aid youkai!


And I think you're a dangerous person
who all the youkai respect.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Yes, yes, that's enough bitterness from you.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
sob sob*
Just what are we youkai, anyway?
","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Maybe you're luxury items?
Well, now the boat's right in front of me.

"???","
Fairies, humans, and all, everyone seems to be
dropping by ... are they after the treasury?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Treasury?
On this ship?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Well, no point in arguing!
I'll show no mercy to any sort of scoundrel!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
My word, to think that there were humans who won't
run away at the sight of this fist ... ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Is this really a treasure ship?
There's nothing here, but ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Oh, she ran away.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Just what are you after?
Treasure?  Or perhaps my sister's power?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What am I after?  I'm trying to figure out what this ship is after!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Hm.
It's nothing to be worried about.


This looks like a ship to you, but it is a modernized, remodeled
version of a certain old, miraculous building.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Once this place is filled with treasure, I'll be able to
bring about the great revival of my sister as I've so dearly wished.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Great revival? 
I don't like the sound of that.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
I won't let anyone get in my way until that happens.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
This sister of yours ... ...
She's a youkai, right?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
I wouldn't place her on the level of a youkai.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hmm, maybe I'd better beat you before you can revive her.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Oh, you're so cold.
And people from above almost never come down here.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Ah, hello, hello.
Nice to meet you, I'm Shameimaru the Tengu.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Huh?
A tengu?
I wouldn't have guessed it by looking at you...

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
No, I'm not a tengu,
I'm a human.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Huh?
Well, what were you saying before, then?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(No, no, I'm a tengu pretending to be a human.
There's something I needed to look into...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Just a-

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(I didn't think it would be a good idea for a tengu to be down here,
but I was able to sneak in like this.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hm, strange to think a tengu would come down here...

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
I thought you didn't want to meet us, so you were

avoiding us.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(No, no, I thought I'd
come introduce myself later.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
So, you can always go see something interesting?
I'm so jealous.
If that's the case, then you need to show me something interesting
to relieve my boredom!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I didn't just come down here to get material for your paper.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Well, this is a good opportunity for that,
but my purpose is to have you strike down a great evil.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Why don't you just do it yourself?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(There are some things even youkai don't like.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Humans don't like being underground, either.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hey, you're pretty good.
Dunno who you are, but they say
a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so
Keep following until you can't take anymore!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Well, this has gotten a bit out of hand.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Geez!
Quit wandering around in front of me, you're in the way!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(No, no, I guess that depends on whether or not
you'll give me exclusive coverage of the invasion.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Wha-!?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(""Full coverage! The Hell Crow's Seven Days War""
I think I'm on the trail of a huge scoop...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Now, just a minute!
I won't allow that.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Very well. Will you interview me as much as you like
and spread fear of me far and wide?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, is that okay?
I guess it would be uncouth of me to try to stop you.
... did you really think I'd say that?
You can't just invade the above ground.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Oh, you have no sense of atmosphere, do you?
Beating you will be the first step in my invasion, then.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Hm, Shrine maiden VS Hell crow, here comes another scoop!
Come out and fight, all you scoundrels!)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
The divine flames that I've absorbed...
will burn you to a crisp with nuclear energy and leave nothing behind!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(...... hmm.
It's... not you, is it?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If you're lookin' for the geyser's source, ya gotta go deeper.
The meanest bird ever is down there, though.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Bird?
So you don't have anything to do with it?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
But, I can't let ya get down there.
Here's where you turn into a wandering spirit.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Phew, you're pretty good, Sis!
I can't believe there are humans that strong above ground.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Are there even any humans underground?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Why did I have to come down to such a
soaking wet place?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
(... ah, ah, ah-
It's fine today...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Bright and sunny? This is the middle of a cave!
Er, wait, am I hearing things now?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(...... it's me. Pure and Honest Shameimaru.)
(Those yin-yang orbs allow us to communicate.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh, I bet that's her doing.
Is this convenient or a pain...?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Well, I would like you to reveal
the darkness of the underground.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh?
A ventriloquist?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
I wonder where that voice is coming from?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Something weird showed up, eh?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(The power of a god...?
I thought this seemed rather strange.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
It's so hot down here, though.
I wish you'd come down here and let me borrow your fan.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Oh yeah, I forgot something.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Ah, I can't take it anymore!
If you think about it, there's no way we'd be
able to find anyone here. It's so hot.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(The cat before said it, right?
She swallowed up a god's power.)
(Shouldn't we be looking for a place
with an atmosphere that fits that?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, that kind of atmosphere...
But we don't even know what kind of god
she's supposed to have eaten.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Actually, I happen to remember a god
like that.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Welcome to the depths of the depths of hell
that none should visit.
I heard about you from Orin. She said a human and a youkai
that wanted to stop the geyser were coming...
But all I see is a human.
Is the youkai invisible?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hey, someone else turned into a youkai!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Come out and fight!)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Come out and... You're not alone, are you?
Maybe there really are two of you.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
One person or two, I've got the power of a hundred!
Anyway, you said something about the geyser?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
I'm Utsuho, and I'm in charge of guarding the Remains of Blazing Hell.
Everyone calls me ""Okuu"".
Well, about the geyser...
Maybe you could have before, but it's too late to stop it now.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
I see, well, I'll trust you this time, based on what
your strength and this sake tell me.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Hehehe, you're far too kind.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You two are going to go right along and keep
ignoring me, aren't you?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Isn't this place suspicious?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Yes, I can quite clearly smell a dope.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, the smell reaches all the way up there?
By the way, what were you saying earlier
about vengeful spirits?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Ah yes, the spirits... it's quite certain that
vengeful spirits were emanating from the geyser...)
(I just used them so that you'll be
free to move about the underground.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Well, never you mind...
Let's make sure we search every nook and cranny of this mysterious mansion.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
...It's unusually busy here.
How long has it been since we've had visitors in the Palace?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, somebody's there?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I should say I am.
It's my house, after all.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Perhaps we should introduce ourselves?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, hey there, I'm Reimu, the shrine maiden from above ground.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I'm Satori, the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
...... hmmm.
You're being awfully cautious of me
considering you're the visitor here.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
No, I'm not, really.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
...... it's another cat.
I think that cat's been following us since the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
It's kind of creepy.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(It's suspicious.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Tada~
Hey, sis, havin' fun in the Hell of Blazing Fires?
The hellfires'll take your body and your soul.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Woah,
It wasn't a cat?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(No, I think it's cat enough.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
A cat's a cat, but don't make the mistake of thinking I'm
just your ordinary cat.
I've been living here
ever since this place was really Hell.
And now I can catch corpses and spirits and control them.
All my hard work has really paid off.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
If you're friends, you're an oni too, right?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Of course.
I was one of the Big Four of the Mountain with Suika, Yuugi the Strong!
Of course, I can't climb many mountains down here.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hmm.
So, you're not trying to attack the overworld, are you?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Ahahahaha!
Why would we want to do that now?
This place may have been Hell once, but now it's our paradise.
We're even thankful for the sages above ground.
They won't let anyone come bother us here.
But more importantly, you!
You're strong for a human,
And it looks like you know Suika, too.
I haven't been this excited in a long time!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
... why am I always surrounded by
people like this?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Well, I haven't seen a new sinner in a long time.
You must have been pretty thoughtless to be sent
to the Hell of Blazing Fires.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
It's not like I got sent here.
I'm just on a little trip.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(This is a hell raven.
She's a humble bird that eats the corpses of the dead in the Hell of Blazing Fires.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
She must eat mostly fried meat, then.
That'll be bad for her when she's older.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(The Remains of Blazing Hell is the source of
the geyser and the vengeful spirits.)
(So, I thought we'd come to see what was going on...)
(But, it looks like she's
eaten something pretty bad.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What?
Spirits?
That means we'd better
take her down, right?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Hey, you're one of those fire chariots, right?
Hey, hey!)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?
Well, we've got a cart for fires at the shrine, but ..

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Hey, sis,
I'm your fiery cart, right here.
If I find a corpse, I'll wheel it in this cart
all the way to Hell!
I'll take your corpse, too!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Man, sis, you really did a number on me.
Your strength is unbelievable.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What's with her?
What a weird cat.
But, anyway, we beat her,
so does that mean the geyser will go back to normal?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Nope, I'm not in charge of the geyser.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Why did I have to come down to such a
soaking wet place?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
(... heeellooo...)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?
And now I'm hearing things.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Oh, hey, you can hear me.
We can talk using your yin-yang orbs.)
(Yukari set them up!)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh, annoying little orbs.
So, now what?
Are you supposed to watch everything I do?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Hmm, and you're pretending to be a human?
You know, I really hate good tengu lies
like that.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(I'm so very sorry.
I didn't mean to come down here to spout lies to you.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, so did you send me down here because you couldn't
move on your own, because there's someone you didn't want to bump into?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Hoho. Well, since we're such good friends with tengu, I'll
look over it this time... but on one condition.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
I only forgive the strong and the brave!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Well done!
Now, let's see what I'm forgiving such a strong person for!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Heheh. Thank you very much.
Well, then, I suppose I'll get straight to the point.)
(Vengeful spirits have begun to appear above ground.
Of course, I'm not saying that this is the oni's doing.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What? Vengeful spirits?
That's the first I've heard of this!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Huh? What's that?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(It would be a problem for you, as well, if they were to
get out, right?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Hmmmm.
Well, you're not lying, right?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Why would I be lying?
In any case, we wanted to investigate these spirits...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(... that was an earth spider.
They say if you see them at night, it was let in by a thief.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I only came down here because you incited me to.
I wonder what's down here in the underground.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(This is...
I can see power radiating from her body.)
(Are you the one who was tempted into eating that god?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm?
What are you talking about?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(You're planning on taking over the above ground world, aren't you?
And the mountain god talked you into it.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Hm? What are you talking about?
The mountain god talked me into it?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(That's right. She was up to no good,
so I took the liberty of looking into it myself.)
(Somehow she brought an incredible power down here,
and not long after, the geyser appeared.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What are you talking about?
I don't get it at all.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Hmhmmm.
What of it? I am indeed the one with the power of a god.
I'm also the one who's plotting to invade the above ground
using this power.
And, so what?
Are you saying you'll try to stop me?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Just how far does this hole go!?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(... it's deep, isn't it?)
(It can't be good for the above ground world
if a hole like this is open to down below.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Are you worried about above ground because of the earthquakes?
If you came down here to see about that, then you don't know
anything about the earthquakes.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh? No need to worry about the earthquakes,
Not if the shrine's okay.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Really?
Hmmm, ummmm, well, whatever.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Did something show up?
...... oh, it's that small fry from before.)
(Are you going to do
something interesting?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Something interesting?
You're the ones that are going to do something interesting, right?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
If we were, there's no reason we'd come so deep into
a hole like this!
Besides, we can always go see
something interesting.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I can tell you're excited, even when you're talking
through the yin-yang orbs.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(So excited!)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Hm, is that popular up there now?
When you're excited, do you talk to yourself -
Or are you just ignoring people?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, I'm not ignoring you.
I'll take out my anger at having nothing to do on you!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
I'll show you how great the power of
The youkai who were banished underground is!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Yep, she sure showed me
How strong the banished youkai are.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Why ever did you come so far underground?
There are too many questions in your mind, I can't
see what you're after clearly.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Ah, well, that's right. A geyser has appeared above
ground, and with it some vengeful spirits.)
(We've asked a few people about it, but so far
nobody seems to have been involved.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
A geyser? Vengeful spirits?
Hmmm... maybe you've come to the right place
after all.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Eh?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I think one of my pets could have done something
like that.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Pets...
you mean like that cat?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
If you want to look into it,
I'll take you to the courtyard.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Courtyard?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
You can get farther underground from there.
That's where my pet will be.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, I've gone too far to turn back.
I guess I have no choice.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""You didn't have to go say something like that"",
was it?
Well, I'm sorry
for reading your mind.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
That cat keeps creeping up on us,
but I just can't quite take it down.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Hmm. Perhaps that cat
isn't a normal cat?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, I don't think there's any way it could be
if it can shoot danmaku.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(According to what Miss Satori said,
that cat may be holding the key to something.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Next time it comes I'll get it for sure.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
There it is!
This time I won't let you get away!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Speak of the devil and she will appear!
You're pretty strong, Sis.
You'd have to be, to beat Miss Satori.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
!?
It turned into a youkai!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(It's a youkai! Let's defeat it!
Alright, come out and fight~)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I think things'll get out of hand if you keep telling me that.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Hahaha, I turned into a youkai?
Humans are a lot rarer down here, ya know.
Well, how 'bout it?
Ya said ya wanted to find about the geyser, right?
I heard it before!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, straight to the point.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Okay, if you're that strong, ya might even be
able to damage her a little.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Is that bird
really that strong?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
We animals get powerful by living really old, or
swallowing ghosts and spirits.
I wonder where she found it, though?
She was able to swallow the power of a god.
She got really powerful, ya know.
Ya better be careful, Sis.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hmmm.
Well, I guess nothing surprises me that much anymore.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Your mansion looked so splendid
I just wanted to get some information on it...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
...... hmm?
You're speaking of things that you didn't think of.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Eh?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Nothing can be hidden from me.
What you're thinking speaks volumes beyond anything
you could say with your mouth.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What do you mean?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
... ""This is such a pain, maybe I should give up the hot springs.""

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
eek

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
... ""How does she know what I'm thinking?""

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Yeeek!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
... ""She's creepy, I'd better shut her up"",
you say?

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You mean you can read my mind?
I guess I don't have to bother saying anything.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(What's this?
I can't believe there's a mind-reading youkai...)
(... hm, hm,
This should make an interesting article.)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
...... griiin.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
... ""Now, how am I going to beat her?""

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Go on, read more.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
... ""Hm, how about this danmaku?""
... ""Or maybe this one...""

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(What on earth are you imagining?)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Such a foolish human.
You're only spelling out
your own defeat, you know.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Here's where it really begins.
Now, sleep with this trauma that will leave you sleepless!

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Well, not bad.
I took you too lightly since you're a human from above.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I was wondering who lived in such a big house,
but you weren't such a big deal, after all.

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Aya","
(Those techniques were...)

","Reimu_and_Aya","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hmmmm.
I think I've seen these danmaku before somewhere...

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Hey, hey, those were my moves before!
It'd be nice if you'd remember them.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I picked the danmaku that looked the strongest
from the depths of your heart.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Eh?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Oh, you're remembering even stronger ones now?
Hm, I'll have to have another look.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Yeah, just tell her whatever,
blah blah blah.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Blah blah blah blah blah.
Like that?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
There's no need to use words.
Ah yes, a geyser that's spewing out vengeful spirits...
One of my pets is in charge of that.
I'll take you to the courtyard.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Courtyard?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
You can go even farther down from there.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Bwuh?
I don't want to go any deeper.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""It'll take me even farther from the hot springs"",
you say...

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What's with this place?
It's way too hot!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Well, the Palace of the Earth Spirits... )
(... was built above the Hell of Blazing Fires
when the Former Capital stopped being part of Hell.)
(We came here because we can take care of both the geyser
and the vengeful spirits in the Hell of Blazing Fires.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What, the Hell of Blazing Fires?
Is it okay to go any farther down here?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh?
A human? How unusual.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Did you come to play underground?
They're having a big feast down there now.
They won't turn away anyone, so go have fun.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(... I've got this TV and this
cell phone-type thing Yukari came by with)
(... so, uh, what's a cell phone?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Are you paying attention? Some living enemy
arthropod is standing right in front of us.
If you're just going to make small talk, don't say anything, okay?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?
Something bad?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
What are you mumbling on about?
Did you come on a trip here to get eaten?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(I can feel something that doesn't belong in hell.
She's...)
(Probably eaten a god.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
See, your body's getting burned up
pretty nicely now.
I want to eat you up right now, but it's not good to rush.
You have to let it fry just the right amount for it to taste the best.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, I'll clip your wings before that.
Humans these days aren't scared of any Hell of Blazing Fires,
much less the birds that live there.
The birds that eat raw garbage up above are scarier.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Hohoho.
So, you're not afraid of the Hell of Blazing Fires?
Well, then, what about a much more terrifying
high temperature, high pressure world?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Aw, man,
what an idiot.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm?
What's wrong?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(The power I can feel inside of her
is a Yatagarasu.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Yatagarasu? A sun crow inside a crow?
She's like one of those Russian dolls!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(A Yatagarasu is a god that controls the ultimate energy.
Reimu, maybe you'd better run.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Too bad,
but you can't escape from the flaming kettle of hell.
This high temperature, high pressure world that distorts even time
will transform the above ground world in a big way.
The ultimate energy is nuclear fusion power!
Won't you fuse with me?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(See? Nobody wants to be with her.
Welp, good luck.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hey, you're the one that came along, aren't you!?
Do something about her!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Who on earth are you talking to...?
Oh, I see, there's an oni above ground.
I didn't know that.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(I knew it, she can't tell what I'm thinking up here.
It's so far away, I'm in a safety zone.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
That's not fair. Oh well,
I guess I'll just have to beat her before she reads my mind.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""The oni will be satisfied if I can beat the master of the Palace.""
Hmm.
Unfortunately, I don't think anything will change
even if you do manage to beat me.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Fighting her for too long is dangerous.
Hurry up before she lays your heart bare!)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, then,
take us to whoever is.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Hmm, her place is...
I think it's at the core of the underground...
Yeah... I can't recommend it for ya.
But, maybe someone as strong as you...
Can break her right down?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Somehow you seem to make me confident and make me uneasy.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(It's okay.
You can't lose.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hey, you. You know lots about the underground,
don't you?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Hey, no need to worry.
I'll take care of your bones and your soul.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(If she picks up your corpse, there's no way
you'll make it to heaven.)
(You'll wander the underground as a vengeful spirit
forever. You can't lose now.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, whatever.
I won't lose whatever happens.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Oh yeah, I forgot something.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Ah, I can't take it anymore!
I can't stay in a place like this.
My lungs are going to burn up.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Well, it is the deepest part of
the Hell of Blazing Fires.)
(Most sinners chose this place as the hell they'd
want to go back to the least.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
It must have been terrible long ago.
I can't believe anyone would get sent to a place like this after they died now.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Ah, you're thinking,
""Hmm, I wonder if she's really the mastermind?""
What?
""Who cares, let's get her anyway!""

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I just want to finish up my business here and
go back up to the hot spring!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
It seems you're of no mind
to settle this peacefully.
I can see it.
The danmaku drawn into your memory!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Here's where it really begins!
Now, sleep with this trauma that will leave you sleepless!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Not bad at all.
I didn't think a human from above would be so strong.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Well done!
Only a friend of Suika could be this strong!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
So, you really don't want to attack the overworld?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
No way.
That's an oni's promise.
The underworld was given to us
in return for sealing away the vengeful spirits.
The underworld is our paradise.
We don't care about the overworld anymore.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(It's been weird lately, though.
The vengeful spirits showed up together with these springs.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Oh, Suika.
So, the vengeful spirits, you say?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Yep, together with a bunch of earth spirits.
Something bad's gonna happen if this keeps up.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
You sure talk to yourself a lot, human.
Is it stress?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(... oh, an earth spider!
How nostalgic.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
I'm nostalgic?
Who are you?
Well, whatever.
You look suspicious, so I'll just beat you, now.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
So, what's so nostalgic?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(... Zzz... Zzz )

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Is she asleep?
Did she get hungry?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Just how far does this hole go!?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
... really?
That's weird, someone should be watching over them.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What are you talking about?
I haven't gotten the explanation about these vengeful spirits.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(That's 'cos nobody's given one.)
(Anyway, I asked this human to look into
it for me.)
(Since we can't act in secret.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Oh, I see!
Well, then, I'll leave it to you, human!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
But I have no idea where to go or
what to investigate?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
So, does that mean there are enemies in this mansion
that can control the vengeful spirits?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Yeah, probably.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Well, we just snuck in...
Oh well, it looks like a youkai den, so it's probably okay.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(This is the mansion of the most hated person in the underground.
The master of the mansion controls lots of vengeful spirits.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
The most hated person in the underground...
They must have a pretty bad personality.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Naw, she acts really grown-up
and she's very mild-mannered, but...)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
... A visitor? Most unusual.
...... I see, it seems my pet has
caused you some trouble.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, are you that hated person?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
That's not a very nice way of putting it.
...... hmmm.
...... It seems you're looking for a fight.
But it doesn't look like you have a good reason for it.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, you catch on pretty quickly.
I definitely don't have a good reason.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
...... now you're trying to think of one.
......vengeful spirits, oni? Hot springs? Burglary!?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hey!
How do you know what I'm...

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
There's nothing you can hide from me.
Perhaps I should have introduced myself sooner.
I'm Satori, the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
My third eye will tell me whatever you're thinking,
no matter how badly you wish it otherwise.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You can tell what I'm thinking?
Gah, people must hate that.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(...... are we there yet?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
How should I know?
I don't even really know where we're going.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Could you be a human?
What business does a human have in the Former Capital?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Former Capital?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Don't tell me you're here for our cursed power?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(No way, who cares about that?)
(Are you the bridge princess?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
You know about me? Who are you?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I don't know anything about you!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(She's a lowly youkai driven by jealousy.
Are you guarding the bridge to the underground here?)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Hmph,
Are you looking down on me?
That lowly power should still be frightening to a human.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Look, I don't know anything about you, okay?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Then experience the power of a youkai of fear
that should have been sealed away.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Stop holding your own conversations!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(We're almost there.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?
We're almost where?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(The world where we live.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Whaa?
Where the heck are we going?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hey, you're pretty good.
Dunno who you are, but they say
a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so
keep following until you can't take anymore!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
But I don't want to go drinking with you.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Geez!
Quit wandering around in front of me, you're in the way!

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh, you're so cold.
And people from above almost never come down here.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Oh, I was wondering who that was! Yuugi,
long time no see.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Huh?
You know who I am? ...... Who are you?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(Me, it's me! Don't tell me you forgot me just
'cos I went to play above ground for a little while.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
That drunken voice ...
Is that Suika!?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Suika","
(I wanna go mountain climbing again, the four of us.)

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Wow, you sure have changed a lot...
You look just like a human shrine maiden.
When did you pick up those tastes, anyway?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
How should I know?
You're not talking to me.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Huh?
Where'd Suika go?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
She's above ground.
Wait, do you know her?

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Above ground?
Oh, her voice is coming from that jewel.

","Reimu_and_Suika","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Keine","
I just made it so that the village was invisible to your kind.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Reimu, we don't have time to stick around here.
The moon is gradually sinking lower as we speak.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Hmm. You seem to be a night sparrow.
You shouldn't attack just humans so often~.
There won't be any more left around here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
That might be so, how about attacking youkai instead of humans?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Oh, never mind. Besides, human forms haven't been seen
on night roads for a long time.
If there's anyone here at all, it'd be non-humans who were
in a big hurry, or had some important reason to be here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Listen. I'll say this once more.
We are non-humans, in a hurry, with an important reason.
We don't have time to waste here.
Will you let us pass?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
The end of this road isn't a place where
youkai like Yukari often visit, though...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Aw, even though you're playmates after so long...
I know. How about we go to the village
and mess with the humans together?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Ahh, geeze, I've said this before, haven't I!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
??

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I can see in the dark.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Ah, human sighted.
I'll make you night-blind!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Goodness, it was only a night sparrow.
It's hopelessly too early for her to be acting like a king of bird lice.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
...was that really a sparrow just now?
It was dark, and I couldn't see well.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
If you see a small bird at night, it's usually a night sparrow.
If you don't treat them with caution, you'll become
unable to see in dark places.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
(...is that really what sparrows are like?
Although I couldn't see it well.)
Ah, I can see the Human Village. I didn't
really want to come here with you, though...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Is it you?
Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
This horrible scene is your doing, isn't it?
Where did you send the humans and their village?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
I won't hand the humans over to you youkai.
I'll make this night never have happened!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Hey, hey.
I can see the humans just like usual, though.
Trickery of this level isn't useful at all,

is it?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
!
Really, what ARE you two?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Don't worry. They're invisible enough to me.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Uu. Your pity isn't helping.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
And you.
You're a half-beast, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I'm human when the moon isn't full.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Not much different from a human-faced dog or human-faced rock, then.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Why are you assuming everything but my face changes?!
I'll have you know the transformation is full-body!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Or it's like Gozu and Mezu, where only the head turns into a beast's.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
...oh well.
If you're going to say that, I won't let you take it back.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Tonight, I'll make an imperial feast out of your history!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Myself aside, this one's history would amount

to some light snacks at best.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Shut up.
Even then, that means every day is tea and snacks for me.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Now, restore the Human Village!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Who knows. Shall we take her down, first of all?
The culprit should be here somewhere.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
What, are you youkai?
You shouldn't have been able to find your way here, though.
Nothing to worry about.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Hey, I'm still human.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Humans are even less worrisome.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Why would you be worried, I wonder?
All this is your mischief.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Mischief?
Nnn, you mean sealing up the earth?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Maybe?
I don't quite get it, though.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
We mean the full moon.
I don't quite get it either, though.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Ah, you're talking about the moon?
That's my master Eirin's most powerful spell.
It makes this Earth into a giant, sealed chamber.
Do you get it now?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
There's no way we get it.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Mm-mm.
Humans can't understand with an explanation like that.
Also, about that full moon-erasing spell.
It's hardly my most powerful one.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Reimu.
She's the culprit. I can smell it.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Is she?
My intuition is, sort of...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Now, return this distorted moon
to normal!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
...It's still too early for that.
There's no way I can undo this spell yet.
Udonge.
Conflict and insanity are all your job, correct?
I'll leave this to you.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Leave it to me.
I won't let a single one of those closed doors be opened.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Running won't stop us. We'll get her anyway
after taking you down.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Looks like it. It also looks like taking you down
won't bring back the full moon, either.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Hmph. I haven't had anyone to fight with lately,
so this is just about perfect.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
I'll show you two everything
of the moon's insanity!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
The moon's insanity?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
It's my hypnosis, that drove the humans who came to the moon insane.
Those humans were weak.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
This person. She seems dangerous.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Looks like nothing we say will get through to her.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
But that distorted moon is so dangerous...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
It's not really harmful to humans.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Ahh? I don't know what's happening, but
a never-ending night has harmful written all over it.
Youkai eat humans during the night.
If the night keeps going, the youkai will stuff themselves until they drop dead.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
There's no way we'd do that.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Gotta exterminate them before they drop dead.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Ah, running away?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Now, let's chase her to the ends of the earth.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Oh, if it isn't Reimu!
What's up?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
There's such a thing as too barefaced of a lie.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
That last one was for Yukari.
This one's for you!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Looks like we arrived at our destination while we were
chasing Marisa.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
You really are lucky.
I wish you could share that luck with my Ran, too.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Damnit.
What on earth are you two on about?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Thanks to you, we know who the culprit is.
You weren't useless.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, we haven't figured out the culprit.
But at any rate, they're in that mansion.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Well, I lost, so there ain't much I can do.
Time to head home an' sleep.
I hope it'll be morning when I wake up.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Sleep for all eternity.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, try not to catch a cold.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
You're too late.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
I've sealed all the doors.
You can't take the princess away now, can you?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Is she the culprit?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Aah, what the heck are you?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Hey, put the village back!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
So persistent.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
You don't matter right now.
The Human Village was supposed to be here, right?
But there's nothing here now.
What happened to the humans and their houses and everything!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Nothing.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
What?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
I thought you were some foolishly-tasty humans, at long last.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Who exactly would you two be~?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Um, non-humans.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Non-humans?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, human or not, I'm fine either way.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
My, that's rare. Seeing non-humans go along this road.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Speak Japanese.
This is Gensokyo.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
The moon drives people mad.
So, I wonder if you can remain in your right mind
while gazing into the eyes of this lunar rabbit?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Okay, now let's go chase that other one down.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
But which door did they enter?
There are so many, I can't tell.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
""That other one""... hey, don't just call my
master something like that.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
The culprit is down this way.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
We've got to capture her before she commits suicide.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
She wouldn't commit suicide, and don't call her a...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Shush, you rabbit.
Keep it up and we'll tear off your skin.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Okay, now let's go chase that other one down.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
But which door did they enter?
There are so many, I can't tell.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Yukari.
Look, that door over there...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Oh no!
I didn't finish sealing them in time.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Is the culprit in there?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
My intuition says so.
Let's go.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Ohh, my master will be mad at me...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
This corridor is strange.
It can't possibly be this long.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
The outside's turned into some world I've never seen!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
It looks like that long corridor has ended now.
How about giving up soon?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Ahahaha.
My, aren't you two stupid.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Hey, she just said we were stupid.
It's because I let a shrine maiden do her things.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
You've got no room to say ""no need to hurry""
when you're the one who dragged me out here in a hurry.
You owe me big for this, so don't you forget it.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Look, there's nothing out here!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
The night's still only just begun.
No need to hurry.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
It'll be okay to put it back.
We weren't thinking anything of you and the humans here to begin with.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Then, where are you trying to go?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
That way.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
This way.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
......
If you're after the ones behind the recent unusual moon,
they're that way.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
See, I was right, wasn't I!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Reimu, your finger is off from hers by 70 degrees.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
You're off by 110?
wait, she figured out what we're trying to do?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
It'd be more strange if she hadn't figured it out.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Move and I'll shoot!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I messed up.
I mean, shoot and I'll move. Right away.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
What?
Why are you in a place like this, Marisa?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Well, eh, I'm just hunting some troublesome youkai,

like usual.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Hey, what a coincidence.
I'm doing some troublesome youkai hunting too.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
What I'm saying is ""hunting troublesome youkai"".
In your case, it's troublesome ""youkai hunting,"" isn't it?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Not really.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
My, I wonder what you can do all by yourself
on a night like this.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Hunt troublesome youkai.
I'm already tired of staring at today's moon.
It's about time to make it be tomorrow.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
So, who's the troublesome youkai?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
You.
You messed with the boundary of night and day again, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
We're the ones who're stopping the night.
But now isn't the time for that!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Indeed.
Don't you have eyes on the back of your head?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Ahh?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, she probably doesn't.
That's how it is.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
We're not exactly sticking, but hold on.
It's not like I can just ignore a youkai that erased a whole village of humans.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
""Humans never settled here in the first place.""
All I did was make it look that way.
I'll protect the humans from this ill-omened night.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
You've been saying ""nothing here"" for a while now...
I'm here, aren't I!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Don't worry about it...
I'll pay you back.
It's not like I'm you.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
Hey, hey, hey.
You've got some real nerve, brushing me off like this.
I hope you?re prepared to face the consequences!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Was that a pun?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Was it?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
That reminds me, I forgot something important
for an evening stroll. Back at the shrine.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
I know what you're trying to say.
A mosquito coil, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
I'm a firefly!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Really, it's awful at night with all these bugs around.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Says the one who's only awake at night.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Yes, because nature thrives during the night.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
There've been lots of fireflies, lately...
Kinda makes me worry a little about the outside world.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
You understand, don't you?
It's not like you to worry, though.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
W-waaaait~!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
The morning will come soon.
After that, I'll return the full moon to you.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
My, aren't you a good listener?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
My spell is already complete.
It's impossible for anyone to take the princess from here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
A princess?
We had no interest in a princess to begin with.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
We only want you to return the full moon.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Don't worry. When morning comes,

I'll give it right back.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
That's not good enough.
We came here to get the moon back

before the morning.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
You're so impatient.
But, look at the place we're in right now.

Do you know where this is?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
??

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
This place is between the false moon and the Earth.
That endless corridor just now
was a false passage that connects the two.
You two were fooled by an illusion that the false full moon
produced, and came here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
And?
So what about it?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Do you have any method of returning home?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
I see.
Let's take care of that after beating you.
We're in no hurry.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
How can someone who was so perfectly deceived by my spell
think they can still oppose me? It's quite strange.
Well, I'm no demon myself.
Until morning, I'll play with you.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I don't quite get it, but...
If we defeat her, it'll solve everything?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
See, that's why she called you stupid.
But you're exactly right.
Everything Reimu Hakurei says is entirely correct.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Aah, if that's what you say, Lady Sagume,
that's just how it'll be.
By hook or by crook.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
If you get it, then go already!
Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!
Consider that an imperial order.
From the part of me that's a heavenly god...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Well, I suppose.
I'm acting under orders too, though.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
You've got it tough, too, huh?
Even on Earth, it's work, work, work.
And us rabbits' working conditions
haven't improved at all, either...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Anyway, my mission
requires me to infiltrate the capital.
So would you mind
letting me use the passage?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Do you think I'm just going to say
'Yes, go right ahead'?
'Eliminate traitors' is written
in our work regulations, too.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Earth's environment is harsh, but
there's never a dull moment, so it's pretty fun.
Well, your home capital is what you make it, right?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Yeah, I want to live on Earth too...
And just forget about work and everything else.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Now, then, it's been a while, but
it's time for me to infiltrate the Lunar Capital.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Ah, right, let me give you one warning.
Right now, the Lunar Capital has started going crazy
thanks to a single lunatic.
Understand that there's nothing left
of the pure land of old.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Oho...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
This is Kaian Passageway #4, I believe?
...It's been a while, so I've started to forget.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Ah, that's far enough.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
I've been told
to not let you through here.
I have no grudge against you,
but I've got a job to do too.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
A... a baku?
This is ridiculous...
What's the most dangerous youkai in the Dream World(this place)
doing here in front of me?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
I'm a little caught up in these events, too.
This much work is more of a matter of duty.
Now be a good girl, have a nice, long sleep,
and forget about everything.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Putting an enemy in a passageway
that only rabbits use...
It's obvious they're trying to
lure me, or somebody, in...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
As you know, the passageway
between Earth and the Lunar Capital is the mental world.
This is the Dream World!
Don't think you can stand against me, an eater and creator of dreams!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Even if there's a nightmare waiting for me ahead,
I have no choice but to go on.
It's my job, after all.
I've got to do it.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
I see...
I may just be here for form's sake, but
I've done my job, so that's enough.
That aside,
you're rather unusual for a rabbit.
Actually doing your job properly...
Perhaps you've got a sense of duty?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Well... maybe I'm still
a little crazy.
Even though this impure world ought to have
calmed the moon's madness down...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
No, this isn't the moon's madness.
What I feel from you is...
...if I had to say, I'd call it
earthliness...
Like those humans, who manage to come up with their own individuality
by embracing the dreams that others prepared for them.
In short, you've been tainted.
By this impure land.
Your impure self will see nothing but lunacy
in the Lunar Capital now.
Be even more careful than you need to.
Now, then, I wish you pleasant dreams.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Eirin","
Right now, all Earthlings will wander forever,
without ever reaching the moon.
And the people of the moon are just the same.
With this, none of the moon's people should be able to reach the Earth.
This is one of my greatest secret spells.
The Earth has become a gigantic sealed chamber.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
She's just like that rabbit from before.
There's so many lunatics in here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
So, Yukari.
Let's beat her up quick, and head back to the Earth.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Oh, it looks like you want to play with me now.
I'm afraid I lack the power to play
forever, but...
Even so, I can play until morning.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
I wouldn't mind playing forever.
But, some other time...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Now, the dawn of Gensokyo is at hand!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
What are you playing at!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Eirin, I grant you one more chance with my power.
If you lose this time...
You there, human and youkai!
With the medicine made by my power, and Eirin's true strength,

you'll never forget this as long as you live!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Geez.
I told her not to let them come this way.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Reimu.
Do you understand what she just said?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Yeah. We're heading the right way, aren't we?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
The full moon, after so long...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Yes, this is the true full moon, as seen from the Earth.
More importantly, a human and a youkai...
Some very strange guests have come today.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
You...
What exactly are you?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
I am Kaguya.
You should have offered your names first, though,
but I'll let it pass.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
It's childish to pass off something like that as an act of kindness.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Who said I was doing that?
Recently, Eirin hasn't let me out of
the mansion at all.
So, these odd guests are most welcomed.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
The shot guests?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Don't talk like you're obsessed with danmaku.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
The human body houses a fragile, round soul.
What those humans live on is a huge, round orb below.
And, what the superior people live on...
Is that lunatic orb behind me.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Well, it looks like what we'll be dodging

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
are some beautiful round bullets, as well.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Don't steal people's lines.
My kindness has limits.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Look, we get where this speech is going without
you saying it, so it's fine.
We're shot guests, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
You two are just so impatient.
Even without hurrying, I'll show you...
The miasma of the true moon!
And, my beautiful impossible requests, as well!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
You've really got too much free time...
Were you just waiting for someone to play with?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Hey, don't be such a wet blanket~.
I've been hiding here up until now, so I didn't have
much chance to go out and play.
But, I'll make up for that today.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, it's fine, I guess.
It looks like the full moon's already restored and all.
All we have to do now is punish the culprit
and set things right for good.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Hm, it's a good thing you ran into
me before you went up there.
You'll be beaten by the power of the ultimate shrine maiden,
which will stop your invasion plans.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Lord Yatagarasu, the Black Sun.
Thank you for giving me your power.
The sunlight that rains down on the Earth
is a nuclear furnace that will create new atoms.
My ultimate nuclear fusion will burn up
every body, heart, phantom, and fairy!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
I'm jealous of the light above ground.
I'm jealous of the gentle breezes.
I don't have anything against you, but
I can make up lots of reasons to attack you.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What was her problem?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(She is a youkai of jealousy binding
this world to the next through her regrets.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
This world and the next?
Aren't there too many people who can go back and forth between
the two? Reapers, ghosts, and...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(That's just because human death has a bewitching
effect on youkai.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hey, you're pretty good.
Dunno who you are, but they say
a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so
keep following until you can't take anymore!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
But I don't want to go drinking with you.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Geez!
Quit wandering around in front of me, you're in the way!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh, you're so cold.
And people from above almost never come down here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(... Reimu, why don't we listen to what she has to say?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I don't even know what we're down here for.
You're after something, right, Yukari?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Just whose tail are you after, anyway?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I don't know.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Oh, are you lost?
How did you wander all the way down here?
Did you wander into some hole that opened up?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Whatever!
I was forced to come down here!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Huh?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(I promised not to let any youkai from above down here.)
(And then you all built a great city underground.)
(But, in return I believe you promised to make sure the
vengeful spirits underground would remain pacified.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Yeah, we have a deal like that, but who are
you if you know about that?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Mmm.
I guess.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Yes, she's thinking,
""Being down here is a pain, so I'll just beat everyone and go home.""

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Exactly.
We really don't need to talk, do we!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
The geyser was probably caused by one of my pets
or one of the spirits in this mansion.
I don't mind looking into it, but...
You don't seem to be of a mind
to settle this peacefully.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Of course not.
Who would take a youkai at their word?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
But, you trusted that oni...
And you're relying on that youkai from above.
I know everything you remember
about that youkai, too.
Now, arm your heart, and do battle
against your own feelings!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Now, this is where it really begins!
Go and sleep with a trauma so frightful it will wake you up!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reisen","
What is this!?
Why's everything frozen over like this?
And nobody's here...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

So the time has finally come.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Oh, my.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
It's been a while!
Have you been doing well?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Aside from you attacking me pretty flashily, yes.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Well, it's for work.
You know how it is, right?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
So just behave yourself
and get beaten here, okay?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Huh?
Why did you beat me?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Sorry, but I've
become an earth rabbit.
Basically, you're my enemy...
No, not you. The ones above you.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Mayday, mayday!
This is a state of emergency!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
That's right, spread the word to everyone
 with telepathy.
To all those selfish moon rabbits.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Mmm, the wind up here
brings back memories.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
So is it true
that you betrayed us?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Fighting your fellow moon rabbits, honestly.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Kyahahahaha!
Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies!
Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic time!
Welcome to a world of madness!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
A swarm of fairies outside the capital...?
Are these the invaders Lady Sagume
mentioned?
Well, it's true that fairies are a symbol of impurity,
but I don't think they have the intelligence to invade.
And the people of the moon shouldn't fear
the level of impurity from mere fairies...
...Wait, that's not the problem here.
What are fairies doing on the moon
in the first place? That's the real question.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Well, you see...
There's a few here who were
brought from Earth,
but there were originally fairies
living on the moon, too!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
So you're the fairies' boss.
You do seem a bit different
from the other fairies, but...
I can hardly believe that the moon's people
would have their hands full with you...!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Who do you think I am?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
I'm a fairy from hell,
Clownpiece.
The moon's people are enemies of honorable friend.
Enemies of honorable friend are enemies of Master's.
And any enemy of Master's is an enemy of mine!
I'll show no mercy.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
I'm not really sure I get the whole picture here...
but you won't get any mercy from me, either!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
They say that a refined fairy's energy
exceeds even that of a kishin.
Taste the impurity of life and death
that the moon's people hate so much,
and let your first death
send you falling into hell!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Hah, hah, hah...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
This overwhelming power...
You aren't an ordinary fairy, are you!?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
W-why...?
But I heard that as long as we fairies,
symbols of life, controlled this place,
the people of the moon wouldn't
be able to do a thing.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Hey, who exactly
did you hear that from?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
My honorable friend.
The one who refined us fairies' power
was her, too.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Refined?
What does that mean...?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
What are you playing at!?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
I'm afraid you can't see the true full moon
from anywhere but here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Whaaaat!?
...is not something that that warrants saying.
We'll punish you anyway.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Well then, are you ready?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yukari","
Not at all.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Not at all.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
My five requests that so many humans
in the past have failed to complete...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
How many of them can you fulfill?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
What the!?
I see. The ones who are stopping the night...
It's you two, isn't it.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
This half-finished eternal night that you have made...
With my spell to manipulate eternity, I'll tear it all away.
The dawn shall be upon us soon.
How's that?
With this, your spell of eternal night shall be broken, and the dawn shall come!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Parsee","
Are you coming to look for our cursed power?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(...... Reimu.)
(All the youkai underground have fearsome,
detestable powers... )
(Just beat her while you're passing by her.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I can never tell what you're going to say next!
I just wanted to relax in some hot springs.
I think you tricked me, Yukari.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Hmhmhm, I'm not tricking anyone.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, speak of the devil, eh?
I guess my intuition is as good as ever.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
You're trying to stop the geyser, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Uh... right.
Though, I wouldn't mind it if the geyser stayed
and only those spirits went away...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
You came all the way down here from above ground,
so I hate to tell you this, but...
The geyser won't stop.
It's too late for that.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(What did you say?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
The geyser is just a hole to let the excess
part of my ultimate power escape.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
I've already obtained the ultimate power.
Every time I use it, the geyser gushes forth.
So, I can't stop it.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Tada~
Looks like you're havin' fun, sis!
Mind if I join ya?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

Aah!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

(You mean, the cat turned into a cat-wheelbarrow?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
It's more fun being a cat,
but I can't really talk like that.
Besides, it looked like I was gonna lose to ya,
so I had to change back.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Are you the pet Satori
was talking about?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(I think she said it wasn't the cat.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
I was watching, and listening.
To my master's gallantry, and your plot!
You wanna stop the geyser?
Ya better not!
She's really dangerous, ya know?
She's the most dangerous bird underground.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
There's no way we can turn back now!
Even if you're a dangerous cat.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Hm, I wonder where our cat went off to?
It's such a pain when she just suddenly disappears like that.)
(I wish you'd take care to program your own familiar
properly. Without any bugs.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Well, if you're gonna go up against that dangerous bird,
you gotta fight me first!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Oh my.
Well, you did manage to come this deep underground~

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm, those danmaku look awfully familiar.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Of course, they're danmaku that stood out in your heart.
I just imitated them...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(In any case, why don't you tell Reimu
about what's in your heart now?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Hmm, how to stop the geyser, was it?
You should talk to my pet, then.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You mean that cat?
I think we met before...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
The cat isn't that powerful.
I have lots of pets here.
In the courtyard of this mansion, there's a hole
that leads to the deepest part of the underground.
She should be there.
... Hm?
""If she's your pet, why not just call her?""
My pet has been avoiding me lately.
I wonder if it's because of my power?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I don't think anyone likes her, not just her pets.
Nobody would get to finish their sentences.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, it's so hot.
I wish I hadn't worn winter clothes.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Those are winter clothes?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I wouldn't have imagined such a hellish place
would be under their courtyard.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(And yet, the vengeful spirits started pouring out when that
geyser erupted. That's not what you promised, is it?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Huh? They're pouring out?
The vengeful spirits?
Well, I can't think of
Many people who've left the Former Capital to go above ground...
I only know of one,
But she's...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(She's got nothing to do with this, I'm sure.
Can you remember any other times?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Hm, let's see...
A geyser probably means it's the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Stop leading the conversation by yourself.
What's the Palace of the Earth Spirits? Can we go there?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
You came here because the youkai in that jewel
told you to, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Yep, you got it right on.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
The Palace of the Earth Spirits is a building right in
the middle of what used to be Hell here.
A bunch of stuck-up folks live there.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hmm.
I guess we should go there, then.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Hohoho, I think it'll be a while before we can set out,
as long as she's there, anyway.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hm?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
That youkai in the jewel knows
what's going on!
Because, we oni
always want to compare our strength to strong people we meet!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Well done!
If you're that powerful, you'll have no problems at the
Palace of the Earth Spirits!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What?
You're an oni?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Uh, yeah?
We cast aside the above ground world and moved here.
Long ago, this was Hell's shopping district,
but now the Yamas have made off with Hell, so...
Now it's just a forgotten prison for vengeful spirits.
Well, that's an old story, I'm sure humans don't
remember anymore.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

"Remilia","
Sakuya.
This one's a decoy.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Well then, let's shoot her down at once.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady.
Are there any injuries on you?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Yes, there are.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
None at all.
---hey, who're you?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Defeating Reisen and Eirin, and coming so far...
It wouldn't be fair if you didn't have at least
one injury.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Too bad. I'm invincible on the night of the full moon.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
First I've heard of that.
---hey, the full moon appeared at some point,
Milady.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady, let's proceed along the regular path.
We'll be at the exit soon.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, the one we saw before is down this way.
But, before that...
Let's go through that door over there.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Ah, isn't that a bit cruel?
I will help you no matter what the situation.
Please rely on me.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Oh my, Sakuya, are you starting to go a little insane?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
The moon granted many powers to the Earth.
Most powers such as magic were originally those of the moon.
Your companions include people who depend on the moon
as well, don't they, miss vampire?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
So what?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya.","
It's a full moon right now.
That means we're invincible. Wonderful.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Heh heh.
We of the moon turned some on the Earth into monsters,
to regulate the Earthlings' impurity.
But, that's all over now.
The Earthlings have sealed the monsters by themselves.
As a result, monsters these days are just nonsensical creatures who attack humans as part of some weird contract.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Our current daily life of drinking tea is much more enjoyable.
I don't see what's wrong with that.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
......

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Gradually, the Earthlings lost their fear of the moon and its night.
They became more and more arrogant.
The night no longer requires the light of the moon.
The shorelines have no relation to the tides' ebb and flow.
And they even say they'll invade the moon itself
in the end, don't they?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Hmph. I've got no idea what those worthless
humans are doing.
But you're from the moon, right?
Why don't you go back to the moon and fight the Earthlings there?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
I...
have a reason that I can't go back to the moon.
I am not an ally of the moon's people.
Nor can I move openly on the Earth.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
You can't go back to the moon, and you have no place on Earth.
You must've done something quite terrible.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
I've been trying to avoid bothering the Earthlings,
and avoid meeting with powerless people.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
An invincible lady and an invincible human.
Would you like to test that claim that we're powerless?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
My five requests that so many humans
in the past have failed to complete...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Perfect!
I think we already fought you a few times as a cat, though...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If I kill you, human, my hellfire cart will get heavy~?
Man, carrying off corpses is fun!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Good job!
Wouldn't've thought I'd lose to a human.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh, it's so hot I can't stand it
I just wanted to be done with it.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Hey, sis, I bet you can beat her for me!
I'll be waiting for you!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What a weird feeling.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(It looks like there's only one road up ahead.
All we can do is go forward.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I wonder what the pet down that road will be like?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Why did I have to come down to such a
soaking wet place?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
(... Reimu. Can you hear me?... )

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?
And now I'm hearing things.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(... I made it so we can talk
through your yin-yang orbs.)
(So I can make sure you don't slack off.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I know we took that oni at her word and
came to this huge mansion, but
I don't see anyone who looks like they'd be in charge.
... there was that cat, though.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
What!? I guess we don't need to talk then.
Some tea would be nice, right away, please!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(...... Reimu, I told you before, didn't I?)
(You should beat any youkai
you encounter underground right away.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Oh well. I still don't know
anything about the vengeful spirits.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Who are you talking to?
... I see, a youkai that's above ground.
...
...
... I knew it, above ground is too far away,
so I can't read her heart.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(I wonder if you're the one who could
stop that dreadful geyser?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
A geyser? Hm, a geyser...
I wonder if one of my pets did something they shouldn't have again?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Pet?
Oh, like that cat?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
But, it seems that human doesn't mind
if the geyser stays.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Reimu...
you should really get around to taking care of her.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
She's one of Miss Satori's pets, just like me, but...
She got really powerful lately, it's like she can do anything.
So, nobody can really take care of her...
We animals get really powerful when we live long, and we
can get powerful by swallowing up vengeful spirits and the like
But, she's... I wonder where she found it?
Hard to believe she swallowed up the power of the gods.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Did you hear that?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Yes.
I wonder if gods are easy to digest...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Oh yeah, I forgot something.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I can't take it anymore!
I'm going to be burned to death before we ever find that bird.
I'm turning into a fried shrine maiden here.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Don't worry, I'm sure we're about to find her.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Oh, the tea at the shrine wasn't
very good.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Don't drink it all while I'm gone!

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
... a cat?
I think that cat's been following me from the Palace,
how creepy.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Do you have any catnip?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Clownpiece","
I don't really get it either, but apparently
it's something really amazing.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Hmm. So she tricked the fairies
and did something to them?
The fairies around here are
really impure, after all.
No, at this level you could say they basically
are impurity.
Being attacked with something at this level
might really send the capital into ruin after all...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Hey, lady... er, madam... why are you
okay with all of my impurity?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Because I'm... an earth rabbit, now.
Once you've become impure once,
it's impossible to return.
But this confirms it.
My master sent me to save
the Lunar Capital.
But the enemy understood the lunar citizens' weak point,
and had the ability to make use of that knowledge.
What sort of person could they be...?
Master and Lady Sagume probably both know,
but they won't tell me...
Either way, since I've come this far,
I'll just have to live up to Master's expectations!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Have they exhausted all other possibilities
and carried out this reckless attempt?
I never hoped to see the
moon's people come to this.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
...Who are you?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
I've never heard of the people of the moon
having an enemy like you!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
To think they sent a moon rabbit(soldier) after me.
Perhaps the citizens of lunacy have descended into sanity.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Who knows. I'm just here to do my job,
so I wouldn't really know about lunacy or sanity.
But there's one thing I can say for sure!
The people of the moon are still in lunacy!
Unwavering lunacy, absolute lunacy!
If they didn't, there's no way
they'd pass this job onto me.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Hoh... if you'll go that far,
then perhaps you have a secret of your own?
A secret plan of the moon that I've had yet to recognize.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Who knows.
But the one who needs to watch out
is you.
I've come here on Lady Sagume's orders. 
This fate has already begun to be reversed!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Interesting... so the people of the moon do not abhor me.
In that case, come at me.
What can a moon rabbit do?
What are the people of the moon thinking?
Now, show me!
The ruined remains of the impure people of the moon!
And behold!
Just what lies beyond this pristine impurity!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Have they exhausted all other possibilities
and carried out this reckless attempt?
I never hoped to see the
moon's people come to this.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
To think they sent a moon rabbit(soldier) after me...
Hmm?
What is this?
Why have you become so impure?
And why have you accepted
all these mistakes?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Kaguya","
I wonder if you can clear them?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
What the!?
I see. The ones who are stopping the night...
It's you two, isn't it.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
This half-finished eternal night that you have made...
With my spell to manipulate eternity, I'll tear it all away.
The dawn shall be upon us soon.
How's that?
With this, your spell of eternal night shall be broken, and the dawn shall come!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, I didn't really ask you to tag along.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
What are you saying? I'm simply worried.
If that bug we saw before shows up again...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Say ""if she shows up,"" and I'll show up right away!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
And now, I've showed up.
How about you hand that young lady over!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
If she shows up, she's fated to come to a bad end, isn't she?
They say a half-inch bug has only one-tenth an inch of soul. 

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
That's 80% smaller.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
Wait, are you up to something evil?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
More like something lethal.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
No, never mind. I have no interest in non-humans, you see.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
The fact that you're not interested is what's worrying me.
Humans might get away with simply being food,
but things lower than them...
*sigh*. What heartless cruelty.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
Eeeek!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
What's over there?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Ahh, crap.
There was a door that I didn't have time to seal yet?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
The one we seek is down that way.
My eyes can't be deceived.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Ohh, my master will be mad at me...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Hey, hey.
Is there no end to this?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
We've gone so far by now, but...
I can't see an end to this corridor!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
It looks like the corridor has ended,
but where on earth is this...?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
That's enough.
Haven't you realized yet, after coming so far?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Damnit!
We fell for it, Sakuya.
That's not the moon!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Certainly, it is a little on the large side.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Well, that's because we're closer to it, I guess.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Yes, you were led through that eternal corridor,
and came to this false moon here.
The full moon is the one key that links the moon to the earth.
If one were to break that key, travel between the moon and earth
would be impossible.
See? You've been deceived by this fake illusion, just like that.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Ah, it's an illusion.
Was that absurdly long corridor just now an illusion too?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
It might've been.
No cleaning mop would stand a chance
against a corridor that long.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Well, wouldn't you need a wet rag and not a mop?
That'd hurt your back.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
That's a very pointless thing to worry about, isn't it?
It's an illusion. An illusion.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
That aside, what's the purpose of these
convoluted things you're doing?
Nobody's trying to go to the moon.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I have no idea what makes you say that
but I think you're right.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I finally found you!
You're the weird person from above everyone's been talking about, right?
I heard you were coming to find me
but I couldn't find you anywhere.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
As if!
First of all, you sent me into this cave,
which is no place to loaf around.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh?
A human? How unusual.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Did you come to play underground?
They're having a big feast down there now.
They won't turn away anyone, so go have fun.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(..... Reimu.)
(That's an enemy, Reimu. Defeat her.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Is it really?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Oh, what a warm welcome.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I don't really know if she's an enemy
or not...
But I guess the usual thing would be to beat her.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Hey, you self-talking human. You're looking for the
power of the youkai who got banished down here, right?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Do I talk to myself that much?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Are you getting tired?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Of course I'm getting tired.
It's not like I want to be down here, anyway.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Just how far does this hole go!?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(... you're almost there.)
(You should reach the Former Capital soon.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh, are you a human?
What does a human want in the Former Capital?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Former Capital?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Hmm.)
(We should have had that cat take us
to its master.)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
I wish we could have finished off that cat.
It might have been attracted by the smell of dead bodies.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
... visitors? How unusual.
... I see, my cat must have
caused you some trouble.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Finally, someone that looks like a youkai.
There's a lot I want to ask you...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
You don't have to tell me that.
...... a strange geyser near a shrine?
...... oh, I think that would be fine, too.
...... Hmm? You're thirsty?
Why don't I put on some tea?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Huh?
What are you talking to yourself about?
I've been hot for some reason for a while
... so yes, I'm thirsty
but if you're talking about making tea
are you a servant, or what?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Oh, excuse me. I'm Satori
the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
There's nothing that's hidden from me.

That's because I can hear
everything you're thinking...

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
The ultimate power?
If a geyser happens every time, does that mean it's the power of a teakettle?

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yukari","
(Reimu, you should be able to see it.
Which god did that bird eat up?)

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
Hmmmm... the kind that can draw a hot bath?
Who knows?
Anyway, we came all this way, so if we
just beat her the geyser should stop.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Hahaha, I guess it comes to that, after all!
Once I beat you, I'm going to go above
ground to test out this power of mine.
Hohoho, that pathetic place will be
reborn as a new Blazing Hell.

","Reimu_and_Yukari","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reisen","
Um, it's not like I really
accepted them, but...
I've stopped being a moon rabbit.
I'm an earth rabbit now.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
W-what?
Such a scheme from the people of the moon...
Dropping a moon rabbit to Earth
in order to strike at me...
I'm genuinely impressed!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Wha? Ah, really?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
But schemes are just schemes.
The people of the moon have made a foolish mistake, as well.
This earth rabbit bears impurity
beyond what is necessary.
Like this, she is powerless against my strength!
Absolutely powerless!
Now, my mortal enemy, Chang'e.
Are you watching?
I'm going to torment this girl
until you come out!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Ah, Lady Sagume...
What's going on here?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...a rabbit?
But the people of the moon should have all
been evacuated to the fake Lunar Capital by now.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Fake... Lunar Capital?
Does that mean everyone's
in the dream world or something?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
Good guess.
The people of the moon have all mistaken
the dream world for the real capital.
That is the Lunar Capital's lunatic dream.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
For you to be so unusually
talkative, Lady Sagume,
something really strange must
be happening after all.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

You're the rabbit that fell to Earth, aren't you?
The one from Lady Yagokoro's place.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"

I never thought the baku would let you
 pass through to this place, but...
...perhaps that possibility
does exist...?
I'll now test the power
of you who fell to Earth!

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
I see, I see.
That's enough.
I understand the reason that
Lady Yagokoro dispatched you for this.
You might be able
to save the Lunar Capital.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Whaaaat?
Save the Lunar Capital??

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
Right now, an enemy of the Lunar Capital
is trying to invade.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Invade?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
And she's using the power of life,
which we people of the moon can't act against.
We panicked, put the Lunar Capital in stasis,
and evacuated everyone,
but that lunatic dream can't sustain
the citizens' minds forever like this.
So we thought we would
relocate to Gensokyo soon.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Hwa!?
Relocate!?
Ahh, that's just too big a shock.
So the moon rabbits that came to Earth...

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
They have no idea, of course.
All we told them was that the Lunar Capital
was building a summer home on Earth.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
...I really can't stand the way the lunar authorities
always hide things just for the sake of hiding them.
But why are you telling me this?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
I'm telling you because you fulfill the conditions
necessary to strike back at our enemy.
Our enemy has the power to
control the source of life.
She's crafty, turning our own rejection
of life and death against us...
...but you no longer reject it.
Your body and soul have both fallen to Earth.
Because of your impurity,
you can travel to where she is.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reisen","
Phew, that's quite a story.
Thank you.
Lady Eirin and Lady Kaguya knew all this from the beginning,
so they sent me and those humans.
They really don't mind
putting people in danger.

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
Because I told you about the plan,
we won't be able to relocate to Gensokyo anymore.
So we have nothing left but to rely on you.
Do you understand?

","Reisen","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Eirin","
There are many fools outside of Gensokyo who are heading
to the moon, though...
More importantly, my only intention right now
is to protect the princess from the moon's pursuers.
If dawn arrives, with things as they are,
no more messengers should arrive from the moon.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Ah, so the reason there were so many rabbits back there
is because they were moon rabbits.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
No, most of those were caught on Earth.
Only Reisen, who you saw just now, is a genuine moon rabbit.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Who cares?
It's fine if we just know who stole the full moon.
Their reason doesn't matter.
All we've been thinking about until now is how badly
we're gonna beat the culprit when we find them.
Sakuya, don't go easy on her.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
I haven't gone easy on any enemies
up until now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
...so, let's fight to the death.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
I won't die.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
You're quite composed.
I lured you out here so I could play to my heart's content.
There's no need to worry.
Once it's morning, I'll return your full moon, you see.
All that's left is to play until then.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
What a relief, Milady.
Whether we win or lose, the full moon will be restored.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Are you going soft?
We have to get her back for disrespecting me,
or I won't be able to keep my dignity in Gensokyo.
The full moon doesn't matter by now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Hmph, what a brat.
Young children like yourself can't stand a chance
against me, an eternal being.
All the scarlet history that you've built up---
Divided by my history, the result is zero.
From eternity's point of view, you are but a mere instant.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Look, Milady.
You should respect the elderly.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
You're the youngest one here.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Also, it was you who was stopping the night, yes?
You may very well incur the princess's
wrath for doing that...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
So, you ought to respect me, Sakuya. As much as you like.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
And they aren't listening.
This is why youngsters nowadays are such a bother.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
I think you'll find this medicinal barrage
more important than your chatter!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Look around, you devils.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Devils plural, huh?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
There's nothing here.
You can see that, can't you?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Hey, shouldn't the Human Village be here?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Ah. I rarely visit the place myself,
but do you come here often, Sakuya?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Yes. Many of the tools we use at our mansion
were made by the humans here, too.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Look closely...
As you can see, there was never anything here.
Okay? Move along, now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
What a bad attitude you have.
What did you do with the village and its humans?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Don't you get it?
I made it so there were no humans to begin with.
Right now, all of this village's history
is under my protection.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya.
Wouldn't she be a good tutor for my little sister?
Teaching her about the local history, or some such.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
A shrine on top of the mountain?

I thought mine was the only one...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
If a shrine maiden like you is coming up the mountain...
Maybe you want to join up with us right away?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Well, this sure looks like a shrine...
I guess there was another shrine besides mine.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
This is the Moriya Shrine,
a long-forgotten shrine of the past.
It was moved into Gensokyo from the outside world
together with the lake.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
You moved a shrine and a lake?
That's pretty flashy.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
My god and I will be taking over this mountain now.
Then, if we can take over your shrine?
All of Gensokyo's faith will be ours...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
If you do that, Gensokyo's eight million gods
won't be so quiet for sure.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
This is also for Gensokyo's good.
Gensokyo will become weak if it continues in its
current state of lessened piety.
We'll lose the power to cause miracles.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
You've gotta be kidding.
I'll be able to restore Gensokyo's piety somehow with my powers!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
I'm Sanae, a wind priestess, descendent of a
long-forgotten line of gods incarnate in the outside world.
Sometimes, humans that revere a god are themselves revered.
Sometimes, shrine maidens can become gods.
Since you're a shrine maiden, are you prepared for
such things to happen?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I don't care if I become a god or not.
But if you say you want a fight, you'd better be ready for one!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
I see.
Then, maybe you should watch and consider the power of a living god...
The divine power to cause miracles!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
You're strong...
If you're this powerful,
why doesn't your shrine have more followers?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I'd like to know that myself.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
I think you'd probably get a great deal of faith
If we even just made you a branch shrine for my god...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
That's because my eyes are really good.
Or, maybe you weren't really hiding.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
See you, human!
By the way, it's dangerous if you go any further?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I'll still be going, anyway.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Hey, it's that human from before.
Didn't I tell you not to go any deeper?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
You really got in my way back there.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Did I?
I don't even know what you're doing.
How can I get in your way?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I have urgent business with the god that lives on top of the mountain.
Will you let me through?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
The god on top of the mountain?
But many gods live up there ...
Let me tell you straight up ...
You'd better leave.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Alright, enough joking around.
I will now take back Gensokyo's spring.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
You should have said so from the start.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
It was the second thing I said from the beginning.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
There's someone who's gathering the spring.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
And you have nothing to do with it?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
Of course not.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Bye.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
Hey!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
And we've only just met after so long, old friend.
Have you only brought me your life as a gift?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
And why am I being called ""old friend"" by this seven-colored magical moron?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Alright, alright.
I don't know why there's some rule
like that, but I'll buy them.
In exchange, you'll tell me
all the information you know!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Ooh! If you're a customer,
then that's quite a different story!
Speaking of information, there's actually one more
rule when it comes to buying and selling cards.
You can only buy one card with each transaction.
Apparently, you get in BIG trouble if you break this rule.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
...Thanks for the valuable info.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Now, go right ahead!
They're all very valuable products.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
The hell's all this racket...?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Get lost!
You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You followed me all this way, huh?
Guess you're not just
some ordinary rioter...

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Who are you...?
And where is this?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
See, things turned out just like I said they would.
A human would be sure to come snooping up here eventually!
I suppose we have no choice by now.
I shall deal with this human myself.
So in the meantime, Master Iizunamaru, you can...

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Ah-hah-hah!
Don't get ahead of yourself.
As if I could let you deal
with her, of all people!
Our opponent is the eminent Hakurei Shrine Maiden,
who has buried countless innocent youkai until this day.
I'll deal with her.
You get back!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Heh heh.
Splendid.
I hereby surrender.
As such, any further conflict is futile.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
How very straightforward of you.
Now, tell me about those cards!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
As I said before, I'm the
one who made the cards.
I figured I could make a good profit using the dragon
gems dug up from the Rainbow Dragon Cave, you know?
I've made enough money off of them by now,
so I was guessing it'd be about time to pack up shop anyway.
But just so you know, I can't stop
the cards from circulating by myself.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
What?
Why?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Because everyone who's taking part in the card trade
just started doing so of their own accord.
And I'm not the one controlling
their circulation, either.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Augh!
It's just been one thing after another today, hasn't it!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
The world of commerce is a complex one.
If you do seriously want to
stop the cards' circulation...
I suggest you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Fine, got it!
I just have to go up there, right?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
...Are you alright with this?
Letting her leave, and reach that god?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of
her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a
washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned,
and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
Getting sorely beaten by the shrine maiden will serve her right.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
....Hahaha.
I see.
That simpleton of a shrine maiden
ought to do a proper job for us.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Reimu Hakurei.
Miss Chimata is a god of the marketplace, and of commerce.
Angering her would be nothing
but disadvantageous for you.
I think it would be best if you simply sold a card,
and received a set profit for it.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Keiki","
You built up this whole plan, and now you flee
in the face of the enemy...! Truly the height of idiocy.
Don't think for a second that I'll let you escape
after you violated my sacred territory to this extent.

build you anew from soil and water!
You shall be an idol without a single flaw,
told of for ages and ages to come!

she's speaking the truth...)

I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the

Who exactly are you?

Oh, yes,
that's exactly right!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
You're another oppressor of youkai, aren't you?


You know, I realized
that gods and buddhas are no more than youkai.


But youkai are hated, and gods are worshipped.
That's because humans decided it should be that way.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Huh?
Well, I've beaten gods, too ...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Hmm, I wonder if it'd really be okay to leave you alone?

Very well.
If you want to fight me, I'll be your opponent.


However, if you've chosen to follow the wrong path ...

before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Perhaps not.
So, what the hell are you people? 
And what is this place anyway?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lyrica","
We are the Poltergeist Musical Performance Ensemble~ 
We were called here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Merlin","
There will be a cherry blossom viewing at the mansion. 
We will enliven it with music.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lunasa","
You, however, can't perform.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
But I wanna go flower-viewing, too.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Merlin","
You have not been invited.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Invited by phantoms? 
I wouldn't like that anyway.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lunasa","
Unwanted noise should be drowned out.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
The young mistress would like to see perfect cherry blossoms this year.
This level of spring is not enough for the Saigyou Ayakashi to bloom fully...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
And is a full bloom a... good thing?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Don't step any further!
Believe me, the young mistress will not hesitate to kill!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Kill who, exactly? You?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Geez!
I'm so fed up with all these phantoms.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Selfishly stepping into someone's garden only to speak complaints.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
!?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
That's not normal.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Sure, my home is full of phantoms, yes.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Now, what was my business here again? 
The lovely cherry blossoms distracted me.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Did you come for cherry blossom viewing?
We do have a few empty places.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Oh, really?
Well then, let's go have a look.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
You still are not invited, dear.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Ah, yes, yes, I remember.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Remember what?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
I'd rather have a flower-viewing event at my shrine.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
While it's true the flowers here are beautiful,
would you kindly return the spring you stole?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Just a little longer.
A little longer and the Saigyou Ayakashi will be in full bloom...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Just what is this Saigyou Ayakashi?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Argh, will everyone quit blathering on?!
I've been steaming mad from the very start,
having these weird cards get made from me!
I don't know about you being a marketplace god or whatever,
but if that's what you really are,
take those cards out of circulation, right now!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
How unfortunate...
A robber who refuses to understand bartering
has no right to enter the marketplace.
Allow me to liberate all of your possessions!
Let your pockets be stripped bare, and painfully realize this fact:
Humans were always poor creatures
who can own nothing at all!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Hey...
That card you're holding...
It's mine...?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
I got ahold of it just a minute ago.
It's the most utterly useless Ability Card of all!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
""Useless?"" Excuse you!
It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
What an utterly interesting robber!
It's a shame that you're going to die here!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) !
This marks the end!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
What a huge moon!
It feels like something's about to pop out, but...
Don't tell me that fox just now is
the mastermind or something, right?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
...Who?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Chimata Tenkyuu.
I'm the market's main presenter.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
The market's presenter? So you're...

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special
occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're
all able to buy and sell goods.
Put another way, you're essentially
alive right now because of me.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
My name's Sannyo.
Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.
You're that shrine maiden from down below, right?
Nice job making it this far.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
I was chasing after card merchants,
and eventually I just wound up here.
So, what's that thing behind you? Looks like some sort of entrance.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Heh heh heh. Wanna know?
'Course, I've got no intention of telling you.
Entry's prohibited past this point.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
A mysterious entrance up on such a high mountain plateau...
It's suspicious! Too suspicious!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
So with that, I'd suggest beating a retreat
if you don't want to get hurt.
You didn't see anything here.
We clear on that?
And if you can't keep your mouth shut,
I'll make sure you can't see anything.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Grh. You're way too strong...

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Hmph. Don't go thinking that
you can hide anything from me.
So, what's that entrance?
You're going to tell me.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Alright, fine...
I've gotta surrender.
This is the entrance to the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
In that cave is a mine full of dreams. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.
I've been watchin' over the place so
that no outsiders wander too close.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Hmph. If they've posted a guard here,
then they're probably up to no good!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Nah, that ain't it.
I'm guarding the place...
because it's really dangerous inside.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human

in the Sanzu River(a place like this).

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Are you looking to get dragged down by some savage fish?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Those horns... Are you an oni?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Well, yeah, somethin' like that.
If you want to turn back now,

I can send you home safely...

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
I'm fine, thanks.
If it's just fish I'll have to deal with, I'll filet 'em no problem.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
That so? Fine by me, then.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
I won't hold back when I turn you into

food for my beloved ancient fish!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Well, I guess you aren't just some lost traveler.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
For your information, I'm headed to Hell!

Crossing the river is just one step along that path.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Who are you...?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I am Kutaka. I watch over

the border checkpoint of Hell.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Ah, so you're Hell's gatekeeper.

Well, that makes things simple.
I'm trying to go in there.

Mind letting me through?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Huhuhu.
Well, the Yama did say that

it's okay to let you through.
But I would hate to do something

as cruel as that, so...

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I'd like to politely request that

you behave yourself and go home!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
W-Well done.
If you're that determined to go,

then I won't keep you any longer.
Even if you end up burning in the flames of Hell,

or if you get pierced by a bed of nails...
I'll forget all about you.

I'm quite bird-brained, after all.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Are you actually a chicken,

by any chance...?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Indeed.

You understand well.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Well, no, your appearance kinda tipped me off.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Oh right, that reminds me.

I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to

trust that beast spirit possessing you.
And with that, please enjoy your time in Hell.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You've done well to follow me.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huff, huff...
This wind is way too strong...
But now that I've finally found you, beast spirit,
there's no way I'd let you escape.
I came down here to Hell in search of a beast spirit
who's plotting to take over the surface world.
Would that happen to be you?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast
spirits you need to defeat...

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Are not here in Hell.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huh?
D-Don't think you can trick me
just by spouting nonsense!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Heh heh heh. I'm not joking, I assure you.
Shall I guide you to the enemy's location?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
(What's going on...?
I know she's gotta be lying.)
(But I feel like I have to
believe her anyway...)

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
That settles it.
If you can beat me,
I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
W-wonderful!
With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the
enemy you must defeat.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Really ...


Even though I haven't been able to do anything for them
for over a thousand years ...


So, there are still youkai who miss me ...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, who are you, anyway?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
That flying thing is so fast!

I'm not going to catch up to it if I'm half-hearted about it!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Gensokyo is so cramped and small.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Where are you going in such a hurry? 

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Out of my way!
Hm, you were here before, too, little grey youkai.

I don't have the time to deal with small animals
that die easily like you!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Really?  Too bad.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Even as we speak, that treasure ship
is getting away, far away...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Treasure ship?
You mean that thing floating in the sky?

Ohoho, are you stupid?
Did you really think that's a treasure ship?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Fine, whatever, I'm stupid, now get out of my way!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
If you're looking for treasure, don't look in the sky.
There's lots packed away in kitchen nooks and crannies.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Aw, she disappeared into the clouds.

I guess I'll have to go further into the clouds.

But I bet there's tons of youkai up there, ugh ...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Hang on just a minute ...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Uh-oh, it seems the shrine maiden
finally caught on...
But I won't give up!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
I won't rest until you all know
the kind of humiliation that
the inchling race has endured!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Inchling!?
They really exist?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Yes, of course!
You've always ignored the inchlings.
None of you understand the feelings
of the weak.
That's why I'm going to overthrow society!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
If you know you're weak, then
you should behave yourself.
That's the law(truth) of Gensokyo!
And besides, how does someone weak like you
expect to win against me?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Ahahaha.
I suppose the strong and weak really are incompatible...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
However, I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the ""Miracle Mallet""!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
The Miracle... Mallet!?
If you have that, then does that mean...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
You're right to be scared.
I can see a strong person trying to flee from me.
Now, my treasured mallet!
Impart your power of dreams to all those of small stature!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Thanks for coming out on your own.
You saved me a lot of searching.
I'll make this quick!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
...So, it's true.
Humans really have gotten swollen heads
now that we've been calm for a while.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Hey, wait...
Aren't you a rokurokubi?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
That's right.
There isn't a human alive who isn't afraid of me!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Wh-What's with you?
You're actually strong.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Well, youkai extermination IS my speciality.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Could you
perhaps be...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
You just realized it now?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
My, my...
If it isn't that shrine's maiden.
The one infamous for
being overrun with youkai.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yuyuko","
Our youkai cherry tree.
We still don't have enough spring to break the seal on its blossom.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
It's been intentionally sealed up,
so it's probably better not to mess with it, right?
Besides, we don't know what's sealed in it.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
How can you say that after breaching through our barrier?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Yeah, whatever.  So, what happens if you break this seal?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
A perfect bloom will occur.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
And at that time, a certain someone will be revived.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Reviving people just for curiosity isn't good.
And again, we don't know who will be revived at all.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Oh, I can invite humans and youkai to their deaths just for curiosity.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Being able to bring death doesn't mean you know anything about bringing life.
What if you revive something really nasty?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
We can't know before we try.
And in any case, uninvited girl,
being here at this point in time is same as being dead.
Or more precisely, being here means you have died.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Even if I'm dead, I can go flower-viewing.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
If I could just have that bit of spring that you carry within you...
I could see real cherry blossoms...
...with that ""certain someone"".

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
""In spring one sleeps a sleep that knows no dawn,""
was it?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
If I had to guess, I'd say it is time for your kind's eternal sleep.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Letty","
Don't humans sleep during winter? 
I mean, you're mammals, after all.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Some people do, but I don't.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Letty","
Then I'll help you go to sleep. 
A deep and peaceful sleep.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Oh, but for a nice deep sleep, 
it needs to be much warmer.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Letty","
If you sleep when it's warm, then you're just like us, aren't you? 
Like the asebi flowers, too.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Shut up! If your kind would just go to sleep, it would warm up already!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
That didn't warm me up very much.
She could have at least attacked a bit more fiercly.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Hold on,
did there use to be houses here?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Straying into here means the end!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
The end?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
Anyway, welcome to Mayohiga!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
The end of what?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
Once you wander in, you can never return.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
I see.
Well, I'm certain I've heard that items from Mayohiga
will bring you luck if you take them home...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
They will.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Well then, the plundering starts n?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
What!?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
This is our home. 
Would you mind leaving, human?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Whatever happened to 
""Once you wander in, you can never return""?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
First of all,
I'll look around for some easy-to-carry everday necessities.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
It's really cold out tonight...
And I can't see a thing.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Is your level of spring insufficient even to push away this cold?

"Reimu","
Well, that might be true.

Long time no see.

Are you literally a birdbrain?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

If you don't believe me, then fine.
Feel free to wander forever in
Hell's infinitely vast space.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Uh, er.
I guess I could hear you out just a little?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Heh heh. That settles it, then.
If you can beat me,
I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
W-wonderful!
With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the
enemy you must defeat.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Who exactly are you?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
I am the leader of the Kiketsu family.
Do you really need any further explanation?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huh? What the...?
Now that I think about it, I feel like
I never had any questions...

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Precisely.
You're just the human who came
to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy.
Nothing more...

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Alright, then spit it out already.
I'm not quite sure why, but I want to get there in a hurry...

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Who exactly are you?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
I'm not really satisfied, but...
Just tell me the enemy's location already.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm,
located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure
located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
In the center of the Animal Realm?! ...Got it!
I'll do whatever I have to!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Just as dependable as I'd expect,
oh warrior of Keiga, chosen by the wolves!
Now, go!
Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
So this is the Animal Realm...
It feels just as suffocating as Hell,
but in a different sort of way.
So.
Is that the ""structure in the
center of the Animal Realm""...?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A human?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste,

or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Would that be the big keyhole thing behind you?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm!
You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in
such a dog-eat-dog place as this?

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
For your information, I'm not from here.
I came from the surface world to
exterminate the beast spirits, and...
......
(Gah, something's taking over my mind!
...Is this the wolf spirit's doing?!)

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Wolf)","
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here
just to destroy the lot of you!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

That aura I feel from you...
Could you be a wolf spirit?
To think that a wolf would be smart enough
to rely on a living human...

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Wolf)","
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance
with that loathsome Kiketsu family!
I shall liberate the human spirits(our prey)

It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

S-so strong! So this is what
living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

(Sorry about that.
It's me, the wolf spirit.)
(But thanks to you, we can gain entry

(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of
the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(Worry not.
Our objectives are the same.)

","Reimu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

This is the first emergency situation we've had
since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

It's like all the youkai I beat today...
Actually wanted
to be exterminated.

I think everyone is
just a little happy.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Happy!?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Even if you declare yourself to be
some youkai-exterminating professional,
You haven't always fought
independently-acting youkai like us.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
It's not like I have the time for it.
I wish you wouldn't cause a ruckus
just to get my attention.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
If you get too presumptuous,
you're going to regret it.
And of all times,
on this night of a full moon.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I wondered what youkai you were.
So you were a werewolf.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Geez...
I lost, even with the full moon.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Wait, wait.
What did you mean by
""world of social upheaval""?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Huh?
I mean...
Even tools like myself can possess power.
Isn't that awesome?
This is no time to be sitting around.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
The tools have power?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Even the youkai who've been docile up until now
have gotten more powerful, too.
That's how social upheaval works!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Huh? They've gotten powerful?
What are you--

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
That inverted castle floating in the sky...
Power is overflowing from it.

What?
What do you want?
This isn't a place
for humans like you.
Leave at once!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
You can't possibly think I'd just say
""okay"" and be on my way.
What are you thinking,
building this huge castle in the air?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
You want to hear?
I bet you do, huh?
To tell you the truth,
we're plotting to overthrow society!
It doesn't have much to do with you,
since you humans will end up under our heels.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
So there are people
who would seriously consider social upheaval.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
What?
Aren't you surprised?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Well, the koto tsukumogami I met earlier
was saying things like that.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
What?
A koto tsukumogami...?
I see.
That must be part of the payment.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
...?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Well, whatever.
That just means we have more allies!
From here on, the strong shall lose their power
and the weak will control the world!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I'm shocked.
I can't believe there are youkai who would
do something no one would benefit from like that.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Nobody would benefit...
you say?
None of you understand
how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed.
So...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down,
I'll give you a taste of this earnest frustration!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Ugh.
How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Overthrowing society...
I won't allow you to cast
Gensokyo into chaos!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Chaos?
Just like a human. You don't understand.
My history is filled with disgrace and oppression,
just for not having any power. 
Now is the time for revenge!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Hey, wait--!
Well, I suppose I should chase her?
Yeah, let's do that.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Looks like the daybreak just arrived.
The stage for our battle is nice and set.
Now, show yourself!
The one disturbing Gensokyo's peace!

Good luck~

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sisters","
So, is your purpose ""Hijacking the flower-view event""?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
I feel like something is wrong...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
You're a human, I see.
Just what I needed.
I shall drain every drop
of the spring from you!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
This ominous feeling...
doesn't make me happy at all.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
So this is why everyone here is noisy...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
...it must be because of a living human.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
...Don't tell me 
this place...

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
This is the place where the used-to-be-living reside.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
The world of the dead? 
I see I've been invited somehow.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
You have not yet been invited.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
In any case...
How can a normal person enter the world of the dead so easily? 
That's just too dangerous.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
You broke the barrier on the way here, didn't you!?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
That one opened right up.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
That barrier was a ""Do not enter"" sign...
You're like a kid climbing a pole that says ""Don't climb"".
Selfishly tearing it, then saying ""That's just too dangerous""?
Nonsense.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
You're quite a talkative phantom.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
I'm half non-phantom!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
That's what needed correction?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
At any rate, with just a little more spring,
the Saigyou Ayakashi will soon reach full bloom.
The small trace of spring that you've brought here...
will give us the last step needed.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
You're quite a talkative half-phantom.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Were you listening to me?
I'm going to cut you down here, and you'll meet your end.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
If I die in the world of the dead, would I still be sent to the world of the dead?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
You will be sent to hell.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Oh, so this place is not hell is it?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
The things that cannot be cut by my Roukanken, forged by youkai...
are next to none!

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
There's enough spring in this place already.
What else are you trying to do?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
It's so cold...
When will this be over?
This is supposed to be the season for sleeping.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
The conclusion is the most important part.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu_and_Yuyuko","
Return beneath the flowers, ghost of spring!

Sleep beneath the flowers, red-white butterfly!

Long time no visibility?

"Alice","
Don't you remember me?
Well, either way is fine though.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
Setting that aside, what did you mean by ""level of spring""?

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
I was referring to the springtime in your head.

","Reimu","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Reimu","
I hope mine's not too high.
Still, why has this winter been so long?

"Reimu","
I came to check up on these divine spirits.

"Yoshika","
Divine spirits?
What're those? Are they easy to absorb?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Huh? You're not the one, either?
How odd...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Now then, I'd better beat these phantoms' boss!

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
You're also heading there
in this storm, right?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Who's theeere?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Oh, if it isn't the Hakurei shrine maiden.
You came at just the right time.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I have no idea who you are,
but you're planning to overthrow society, right?
Sorry,
but this plot of yours ends here!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Were there really any youkai
who would run amok in this lake?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Hey, you!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
You're that famous shrine maiden,
aren't you?
Huh?
You don't have a weapon.
Does that mean you haven't
come to exterminate me?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I came to exterminate you,
but that purification rod, well...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
You're underestimating me!
You ought to reaffirm the terror
that we youkai hold!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
And here I thought that mermaids
were a quiet sort of youkai.
Something's definitely
going on.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Youkai are rampaging
this close to the Human Village!?
We've got a bona fide
incident on our hands.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You showed up fast.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
All these normally docile youkai
are going crazy lately.
Why is that?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
I don't know.
Maybe it's just coincidental?
At the very least, I'm acting on my own will.
...Probably.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Hum.
That seems odd.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
I don't even want to come out
on nights of the full moon, either.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Why's that?
You were all upbeat just a little while ago.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Well, look...
It's a pain to clean up the hair that falls out.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Ah... I see.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
What the heck is this creepy storm?
There's got to be an enemy around here!
Based on my experience!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Wait a sec.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Why don't you fight with me?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
See? I knew there'd be a youkai.
I'll take on you or anyone.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Now, now. That's my prey, you know.
Swiping her away is not very admirable behavior.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Hmmph!
It's your fault for running away.
I saw you fighting her earlier, anyway.
Your plain, linear music
won't work on her, big sis.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Err...
I don't really care, so can we start now?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
All right.
Let's do this, then?
It's always been my dream to
fight against a human and win, you know.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Well, whatever.
I'll just look for another opponent.
I'll leave the rest to you.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Hey, wait...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Who are you looking at?
You're messing with ME!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
The meek have gained power
in this world of social upheaval.
Even mere tools can rule the world!
I'll make you the foundation we'll stand on!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Oh, geez.
You're strong-

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Have you come to exterminate me?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Ichirin","
... what's that?
You mean, that shrine maiden has ...?


Unzan tells me
you've been collecting the flying treasure.  Is this true?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What are you talking about?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Unzan would have no reason to lie to me.
You've been collecting the fragments flying through the sky, haven't you?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, if you're getting in my way,
maybe that wish will come true.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
You don't have to bother.
Would you tell me what exactly you plan to do
by getting these spirits so riled up?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Mm?
What do I plan to do, indeed?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Whooorgh!
I'm done fooooor?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Now, spit it out!
Just what were you protecting?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
U-Uh...
ugh, oogh...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Huh?
Time to sink back into the earth already?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Zombies are eternal and undying!
Who are you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
I've had enough of this.
Pity that your head's rotted away, too.
Oh well.
I'll just have to press on ahead.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Ahhh... at last...
The door to the great mausoleum will finally open...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
There's no question.
This is where the divine spirits are gathering!
And it's clearly apparent, too.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Ah, that was quick.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Who are you?
Could it be...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
It seems you took care of my
cute underling just now...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Cute underling?
You mean that rotten underling?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Yes. She's so rotten and cute, isn't she?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
I see.
So you were manipulating that corpse.
What are you doing, leaving that ill-bred
and pointless guard out here?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Ill-bred and... pointless?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Yeah, pointless. Her head's rotten.
She isn't any use as a guard at all.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Ah, but there is a point, after all.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Hup.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
See? My jiang shi's selling point
is her toughness.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
...
So you don't realize that you have to sit out
a round if you get beat, huh?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Now, can you handle another round?
With this girl who has absorbed all the divine spirits that gathered in the tomb.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
No need to ask!
Now you've made it clear!
The disturbance among the divine spirits is the work of someone with evil intentions!

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
As expected from one of Gensokyo's shrine maidens.
To think you could hurt someone who has been trained in creating elixirs of immortality.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Now, stop these abnormal divine spirits!

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
I haven't done anything to the divine spirits.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
You lie!
You can't hide all these divine spirits gathering here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
They are here because she
is about to be resurrected...
She can embrace many desires, after all.
Even human desires would gather around her.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
So the evil overlord is about to be resurrected,
or something like that?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Evil overlord?
No, not at all.
The evil overlord has already been resurrected.
Just a little while ago.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Hm?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
The one who set up a temple here
as if to prevent her from resurrecting...
She's the true evil overlord.
She built a temple to protect the youkai.
The person within here is a sage upon whose shoulders rests the future.
She will surely destroy all youkai for us.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Hmmm.
Well, whatever.
Either way, I'm gonna fight.
I don't want to let anyone weird get resurrected.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
This is another strange tomb, huh...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Ahh... the fateful day hath finally come.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Thou who hast praised my resurrection: speak now, and name thyself.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
I didn't praise anything.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Hm?
Pray tell, what design hath led to my resurrection?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Keiki","
You're from the Gouyoku Alliance, right?
Famous for being ridiculously prideful, but
lacking in capabilities in every other area...

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Eagle)","
Hmph. But if I defeat you,
I can steal the Animal Realm's top seat!
I heard that you're weak against living humans, too!
Now, have at thee!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Heh heh heh.
You there, human.
Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
I am the sculptor god(Idola Deus) who protects the
human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other.
Don't you agree?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
F-fellow humans...?!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Eagle)","
Don't be fooled, shrine maiden!
She's no ally of humans at all.
She's a wicked god who drove the human spirits
who summoned her to their destruction!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
U-urgh...
I feel like I've gotten dragged into something really obnoxious.
But I can see an evil aura around you!
I'll beat you for starters, and then think things over!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Ah. Your intuition certainly isn't very sharp.
I'm saying that I'll let you off the hook if you
back off now, but you didn't notice at all...
What a shame.
What a crying shame...

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Eagle)","
(Human, this is bad!
We let her stall for too long!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts!
Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Eagle)","
We must retreat for now!
RUN!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
You built up this whole plan, and now you flee
in the face of the enemy...! Truly the height of idiocy.
Don't think for a second that I'll let you escape
after you violated my sacred territory to this extent.
I'll destroy your body of flesh, and
build you anew from soil and water!
You shall be an idol without a single flaw,
told of for ages and ages to come!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu (Eagle)","
You've done well to survive this long, human!
Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now!
Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Warrior of Gouyoku, chosen by the eagles!
I trust that you're not just talk!
Now, go!
Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
So this is the Animal Realm...
It feels just as suffocating as Hell,
but in a different sort of way.
So.
Is that the ""structure in the
center of the Animal Realm""...?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A human?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste,

or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Would that be the big keyhole thing behind you?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm!
You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in
such a dog-eat-dog place as this?

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Huh?
You were acting like you knew me a second ago...
...Wait, are you a human?!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Yep, I'm human!
I thought I'd go exterminate the beast spirits,
but somehow I wound up here.

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
There?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
That inverted castle floating in the sky...
There's power leaking out from there, you see.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
What?
What do you want?
This isn't a place
for humans like you.
Leave at once!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
You can't possibly think I'd just say
""okay"" and be on my way.
What are you thinking,
building this huge castle in the air?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
...Ah.
I see, that purification rod...
It seems to have gained a sense of self.
So that means that led you here,
doesn't it?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
What?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
This is a problem.
The price for that might be too big.
I might not be able to overturn
society so easily now...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Hey,
are you...
Are you seriously trying to overthrow society...?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Heh heh heh.
Absolutely.
From here on, the strong shall lose their power
and the weak will unify the world!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I'm shocked.
I can't believe there are youkai who would
do something no one would benefit from like that.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Nobody would benefit,
you say...?
None of you understand
how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed.
So...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
In this inverted castle where everything is overturned,
I'll give you a taste of this earnest frustration!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Ugh.
How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
That's it? And you were
trying to overthrow society?
I've defeated tons of youkai
stronger than you, you know.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Were there really any youkai
who would run amok in this lake?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
It's you!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
You're that famous shrine maiden,
aren't you?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Oh, a mermaid?
Is that all?
You're just a small fry.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
It's been ages since anyone
took us seriously.
It's about time for us youkai
to flourish!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
And here I thought that mermaids
were a quiet sort of youkai.
Something is definitely
going on.
This purification rod is
worrying me a bit, too.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Youkai are rampaging
this close to the Human Village!?
We've got a bona fide
incident on our hands.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You showed up fast.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Have you come to exterminate me?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Thanks for coming out on your own.
You saved me a lot of searching.
I'll make this quick!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
...So, it's true.
Humans really have gotten swollen heads
now that we've been calm for a while.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
A small fry like you shouldn't be
acting so huffy!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
...Says the powerless human.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
I'll give you a nightmare every time you see a head!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Wh-What's with you?
You're actually strong.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Well, youkai extermination IS my speciality.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Could you
perhaps be...?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
That's right!
Do you not see this purification rod!?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Not yet.
I haven't given up!
As long as we have that treasure,
we can become as strong as we want.
...As long as we can turn a blind eye to the price.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Hey, wait!
Is she trying to get away?
That's something a youkai who's all talk would do.
Actually, it almost seems like
she's leading me instead.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Ichirin","
Ahaha, well, thank you for finding them
for the mice!  I'll take them all!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
How splendid.
I hadn't thought there were still humans like this in this world.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
There's nothing great about
being praised by a youkai.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Still, you don't even compare to the soles of my sister's feet.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
It doesn't sound like it would be a good idea to let you revive your sister.


I can't let youkai run around that I can't handle.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Oh, are you saying you're going inside now?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
But, there's nothing here ...
How does this ship stay in the sky?


Things I don't understand are generally no good.


This ship must be an ill omen, too!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Oh, please don't take that the wrong way.
I was just looking for some treasure I detected around here.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Treasure?
Were those rumors about the treasure ship true?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Treasure ship?
There's no such thing.


Oh, wait, my little mice
were reacting to you.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, I am a human treasure.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
My mice do like the taste of human flesh.


They say that cheese just can't compare to
certain other red foods.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Humans aren't delicious enough
to be made fools of by mice.


Hm, but those mice were looking for treasure, too.


How suspicious ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Please wait just a minute.
You're so fast~

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Did you need something?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Need?  Well, I don't know ...
It's just that humans flying through the sky are so unusual ...


Er, I don't mean that in a bad way.
I'm just kind of interested, that's all.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hm?  It's just a normal umbrella monster.
What's the matter?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Well, I've been really bored lately ...


Nobody's ever surprised by an umbrella flying all by itself ...


Hm, it looks like you're not surprised, either.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Why do I have to be surprised by something like that?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Oh, I remember the good old days.
We youkai used to be rulers of the night, but ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
It's daytime right now ... ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
If anyone were even a little surprised by me,
 they wouldn't be able to walk straight.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Yes, yes, that's enough of your old time stories.
Would you mind please mov-...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
These days you have to punish someone a little
to surprise them, don't you!?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Booo~?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
I see, then you'll seal me away again?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Yes, exactly!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
You ... really don't think the same way
that I do, do you?


That humans and youkai can live together as equals
in the light of the Buddha ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Th-there's no way!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Then why did you lift the seal?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well ... because it would've been scarier if the youkai did it!
It would be better for me to lift it myself ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I dunno.
I'm just here to stop suspicious characters like you
from resurrecting.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Hm.
I see.
Art thou the final trial I must conquer, that I may
be resurrected in full?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
How did it end up like this?
You dead people are all morons.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
You need to keep them in check!
I mean, they're just ghastly.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Well, I don't know exactly what's going on...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
...but if you want to know about the spirits,
you'll have to start with beating me!

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
So?
What exactly were you talking about?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Well, you see all these spirits swarming around?
Yeah, what are those?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
These are divine spirit children.
Fleeting thoughts, born from the prayers of humans.
Ghostly as they may be, they're not related to the spirits here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
I see.
So coming to the Netherworld was a mistake?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
I'll give you a hint.
The cemetery behind the temple isn't suspicious.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Hmm...

There really are more spirits gathering
around the temple than in the Netherworld.
Still, it's strange...
Yuyuko said these were ""divine spirits""...
But are divine spirits really
supposed to be this numerous and shoddy?
These aren't so much divine spirits as just
the voices of souls taken shape...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Good morning.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
You always gotta give a proper greeting.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Er, uh, good morning.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
One of Myouren Temple's precepts is
""greetings are a mental oasis.""

Ah, that's right,
this is a youkai temple.

"Miko","
While I was alive, I had the ability to understand
ten people's words simultaneously.
During my long sleep, I acquired the power of faith, and now,
I can hear humans' desires.
Desire tells of a human's true character.
To understand the ten desires of a human
is to know them fully.
In the past, the present...
And the future...
Your next line is...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Hey, hey, wait a minute!
Give me a chance to talk, too!
I've come all this way, you know!

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

There is no need for that.
Because I have already seen through
all of your actions.
That's right, you will now bare your fangs at me.
Without any reason to do so.

That's right.
Without any reason to do so!

This era, when humans deny my existence

And I shall become a living legend!

Whatever the case, I was resurrected to
protect this area from the temple's inhabitants!
You shall become one of our companions!
By the danmaku awakened from a deep sleep!

Very well!
I shall vanquish thee, and so return to the world of the living in full.
Then, the Crown Prince shall rise anew.

secret art of the Mononobe and the way of the Tao upon thee!

Silence, you!

Are you saying you want
me to guide you?
...Heh heh heh. All right, fine.

Would you rather return to Gensokyo?

to the world beyond, after all?!

Whoa, that's some power all right.

What a frightenin' thing to say...

I have no business with those who lack

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

","Reimu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Just as I'd expect from someone

trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Oh, if it isn't the Hakurei shrine maiden.
Hm... it looks like your purification rod
has some of my treasure's power.

as one of my allies?

Huh?
Who are you calling an ally?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

With the shrine maiden's support,
I'll be able to turn Gensokyo upside-down with no problem.

You know I'd never go along with
something like that, right?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Tools can't speak, and they're worked
and worked until they fall apart.

and you have memorial services when they break...

satisfactory are the masters(powerful) who use them!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Ummm?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
So? That tool of yours seems
happier now, doesn't it?
You're using it so gladly that
I didn't even have to ask.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Well, uh, that's...
ummm.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Now join me, and create a world where the tools(weak)
can spend their days in happiness!

But still!
There's no way I can ally myself
with someone trying to overthrow society!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Someone like you, who was born into power,
wouldn't know the joy of finally obtaining it.
However, if you look at your purification rod,
you can see that you feel hesitation.
I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the ""Miracle Mallet""!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
The Miracle... Mallet!?
If you have that, then does that mean...

your weakness and ally with me.
Now, my treasured mallet!

exterminated.

I think everyone is
just a little happy.

Even if you declare yourself to be

Well...
There'd be no end to it.
I can't go around fighting
the ones not making a mess.

with no questions asked.

"Kagerou","
Hahaha.
All right, I'll take you on...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

There's no other choice but to get wild.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I won't have any mercy on wild youkai!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
What a pity. And on a night
with such a beautiful full moon...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I wondered what youkai you were.
So you're a werewolf.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Geez...
I lost, even with the full moon.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

not just raw power.
Great, now the purification rod
smells like animal.

From now on, I'll have to make sure I can

I will resist you with all my strength.

How suspicious.


And there were those fairies that were acting like they
were possessed by something ... that's bothering me.

... ... there was a response from around here.

A corner of the infinite area of Makai.

But, you happen to have appeared with it.
I'll have you hand it over now!

How strong ... ...
When did humans get this strong?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hm, a compliment from a youkai ... ...

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

It makes me remember how Hijiri was human once, long ago.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Huh?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Humans get strong, don't they?
The earth must be full of strong humans now.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, I don't know ...
Wait, the ship isn't stopping.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Yes, it's in auto-mode.


Since you came onboard with the treasure,
we've been headed towards our final destination.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Huh?
 Just a-

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Is someone there?

A human ... ...?
Or have you also given up your humanity?

There you are.
A youkai of ill omen.

I-ill omen?

Tell me what this ship really is!

Oh my, not so loud ... ...
Are you sure you want to come onboard?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I'm already onboard.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Woah, the captain already?
How convenient!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

We don't take any passengers who have any lingering
connection to this world; what about you?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Huh?  You mean you're going to ... the world of the dead?
I'm sick of seeing ships like that.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

No, we're not going there.


This ship is bound for Hokkai,
the world where Hijiri is imprisoned.

Hmm?
So you came to Makai, too?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

I guess I've got some treasure.

Is it over?

Anyway, what's with that ""'twas a rousing battle"" stuff?
She lost.

it's like a starry sky...
Somehow...
...this place doesn't feel very sinister at all.
Was I mistaken?

I have observed all of your actions.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

to watch you.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Hm?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
I have seen your occupation as a youkai exterminator,
but I have also seen your camaraderie with youkai.
You are friends with the youkai monks who aimed
to deny my resurrection, are you not?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
You mean Byakuren?
She's just a business rival. (In a religious sense.)
Anyway, what was that about looking
into the past?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
Sure is.
It's a temple for youkai that is kind to youkai.

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Well, then I'll have to exterminate you right away!

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
What are you here for?

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Hm?
Just checking up on things.
The divine spirits don't appear to be
gathering within the temple itself...

Divine spirits in the cemetery, huh...

","Reimu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Reimu","
Hm, you're that?

A youkai requesting a youkai extermination...
Fine, then.
I'll beat you all at once.

Exactly. Such a weak-willed human

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

I don't think you'll have much trouble,

judging by the power you have...
But you can't keep that weak mindset.
The spirits of Hell will sneak into your heart

as soon as they find an opening.

If you want to survive very long,

you'd best keep your wits about you...

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You've done well to follow me.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Huff, huff...
This wind is way too strong...
But now that I've finally found you, beast spirit,
there's no way I'd let you escape.
I came down here to Hell in search of a beast spirit
who's plotting to take over the surface world.
Would that happen to be you?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast
spirits you need to defeat...

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Are not here in Hell.

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Eh?
I-Is that true?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Indeed it is.
Shall I guide you to the enemy's location?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
There's no need to apologize.
You're just the human who came
to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy.
Nothing more...

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
Yeah, it feels like you're telling
the truth. Why is that...?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kagerou","
You're so cruel...
I didn't even want to come out today,
but I fought you anyway.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
You didn't want to come out today?
Even though it's a full moon? Even though you're a werewolf?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Well, because I get all hairy...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
I-I see.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
What the heck is this creepy storm?
There's got to be an enemy around here!
Based on my experience!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
I spy...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Someone who looks like they could be my opponent...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
See? I knew there'd be a youkai.
I'll take on you or anyone.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Wait a sec.
I found her first.
First come first served,
big sis.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
And why's that?
You saw her first,
but your shoddy music won't be enough...
...to defeat this tsukumogami user.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Reimu","
Tsukumogami user!?
Don't speak of me as if I'm a youkai.
I'm here to exterminate youkai like you.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Hmmm......
I thought
you were one of us for sure, though...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Well, whatever.
I'll leave her to you, Benben.
See you later?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Ichirin","
... hm?
You mean, this shrine maiden has ...?

Unzan tells me you're after the fragments
of the flying treasure.  Is this true?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
No, I'm not.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Unzan would have no reason to lie.
Excellent!

You don't have to hide it.
You're collecting those fragments flying through the sky, right?

You must be trying to revive my sister as well!
How splendid.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What the heck are you talking about?
I just thought there were riches on this treasure ship!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
It's okay.
Now, hand over the treasure you've found!

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
You're quite strong.  Unzan says you must be
a very famous person.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
R-really?
Well, that may be.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What?
You're just a plain old youkai.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
You don't have to be so mean!
I've had lots of free time lately~

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I'm chasing that ship right in front of us.

I don't have time to waste on small fry like you.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Oh, you can play with me
while you're chasing that ship, can't you?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hmph.  It must be nice to be a youkai with spare time.
Even if you only exist to be exterminated.

Still, there are too many to take care of them all,
so I'll leave you for next time.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
This is why humans aren't any fun.

Why can't you just make time for me?
Shouldn't you plan extra time into your schedule?

You can go find that treasure ship any time.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Extra time is pointless for me right now.
I don't want to waste a single second.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
But the pointlessness is what's really beautiful.
It would be terrible if everything in life were all planned out.


Even tools aren't beautiful just because they're functional.
The useless parts are what make us youkai ...

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Why am I getting lectured by a cursed umbrella!?
Fine, I'll beat you while I chase it, okay?

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Just fall out of the sky, you stupid umbrella youkai.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Oh, humans are so cruel.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Seems to be.
That's why my dowsing responded to you.


But, that's not the only treasure
I've been looking for.


Maybe I'll test the power of this Bishamonten pagoda on you
before I hand it over to my master.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I'm glad I got out of Makai,
but I can't go any farther.


Hokkai must be under this barrier, but ...


It's sealed with a seal I've never seen before.


Just what's sealed away in here, anyway?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
You're the human who found the treasure, aren't you?


You look greedier than I'd imagined.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
How rude.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
I'm sorry, you're quite right.


I simply thought that if you'd made it this far,
maybe you were some sort of ascetic scholar.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Well, I do mean to learn a lot while I'm here.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
I am the representative of Bishamonten,
a devotee of Hijiri's creed.


Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought,
 as well as the fragments of the Flying Storehouse you possess,


We can break the seal here.
We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
What's sleeping beneath this seal?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Hm?  You gathered all the treasure
without even knowing that?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Of course I don't know!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
It's a human saint who helped
both youkai and humans without distinction.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Saint?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Yes.  She was a wonderful person.
Yet, for some reason humans sealed her away.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Hm, it's some kind of saint ...?
It's not some bad guy?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
The humans were so foolish.
The foolish humans wanted to deny the existence
of anything that wouldn't benefit them, so ...


Since she wanted to use Makai's power to help youkai,


She was sealed away - for something as simple as that.
Isn't that unreasonable?



","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Look, she was doing bad things, right?
If she's a friend of youkai ...


I'm going to have to beat you too, okay?
You're a youkai, after all.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Very well, if that's your idea of justice.


However, if you've chosen to follow the wrong path ...

Then you'll have to bear witness to the light of dharma which is even brighter here in Makai --


And bow down
before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
How splendid.
I can see how you could have gathered the treasure.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Youkai have been complimenting me all day.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
That's because you've gathered the fragments of the Flying Storehouse
and helped us revive Hijiri.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
Not that I had any intention of doing so.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Well, let's begin the preparations to lift the seal.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I- I guess I can't go back after coming all this way
without seeing this Hijiri or whatever.


I wouldn't be able to sleep without knowing.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Splendid!
You have a wonderful heart.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I can't sense anyone at all, but ...


Anyway,
what's *with* this world?


All that ominous atmosphere from before
 is completely gone ... ...


It's just creepy in the opposite way.

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
O, the world of dharma is filled with light.

Are you the one who liberated this world?

","Reimu_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Misumaru","
You'll die if you proceed any further.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
Turn around and leave, right now!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
I'll die...?
You're kidding, right?
You're obviously trying to hide something from me!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Sigh...
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease
to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
I won't be able to breathe...?
Then I'll just search the place top to bottom before that happens!

I'll find all of this cavern's secrets!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Honestly, now.
I'm not even telling you this as a threat...
I can't afford to lose the inheritor
of the Yin-Yang Orb to suffocation.
If we'll lose you either way,
at least let it be by my hands!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Splendid!
To think that the Yin-Yang Orb that
I crafted has been mastered to such a degree.
It is an honor to the Tamatsukuri-be. 

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
W-what are you saying...?
I'm starting to feel faint.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
I told you, didn't I?
The oxygen levels here are already
just about half of that on the surface.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
W-what are you doing down here...?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects
that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before
the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
...I want to hear more,
b-but I can't take it any longer...
Dammit, this place was a total bust!
This is no place for humans to be!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Indeed. Mining sites in general are
 a harsh environment for humans, not just here.
I suppose a price must be paid for
stealing the resources of the gods.
By the way, you've come to investigate
the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside
and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making
profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
Now go on back!
O successor of the Yin-Yang Orb, Reimu Hakurei!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
A human's here!
See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something
like this up for long...!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
The sun's plunged right on down by now.
It'll be hard to find anyone
carrying cards at this rate.
Looks like my only choice is to try again some other time...

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Why, what's this?
We seem to have an interesting guest.
Is something the matter,
Miss Hakurei Shrine Maiden?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
""Something?""
Well, um, that is to say.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
This stretch of mountain is the territory of we tengu.
It isn't a place that humans ought to
set foot in so easily, shrine maiden or no.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
You're a tengu, from the looks of it.
There's something I'd like to ask you.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Oh?
And what would that be?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Well, it's about this whole
Ability Card business...
Back in that cave just now, I was told that there's
someone who knows about them up on the mountaintop.
I came up here to investigate what
those Ability Cards really are.
Anything you can tell me?

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
The Ability Cards?
I don't just ""know"" about them.
I created them, as a matter of fact!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Huh? What?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
There you are!

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Reimu","
Okay...?
I don't totally follow.

","Reimu","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm,
located next door to Hell.

That's the enemy's main base.

All right! We've got the enemy's location!

So this is the Animal Realm...
It feels just as suffocating as Hell,
but in a different sort of way.
So.
Is that the ""structure in the
center of the Animal Realm""...?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A human?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

such a dog-eat-dog place as this?

","Reimu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Reimu","
For your information, I'm not from here.
I came from the surface world to

Could you be an otter spirit?

That's right! Now, face the elite

underhanded tactics of the Kiketsu Family!

Once again, thank you.)

for just a little longer.)
(Once the idols are destroyed, we beast spirits
will take back control of the Animal Realm.)
(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of

Let's join forces and take them down!)

That stupid captain, does that mean
you were sailing to Makai?

I see they must have brought you here to Makai
with your treasure sometime.


Captain Murasa's done a good job.


Meanwhile, I've also found the other treasure
that I've been looking for.


Maybe I'll test the power of this Bishamonten pagoda on you
before I hand it over to my master.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
So this is Makai?


That explains why I feel so horrible being here.


So they came all the way down here to break a seal or something?
That can't be good.

","Reimu_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

I've been waiting for you!


You're the human who gathered the flying treasure, yes?
You look a lot more scrawny than I imagined.

Just as I'd expect from someone

trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
And who're you?

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I am Kutaka. I watch over

the border checkpoint of Hell.
I've been testing you,

to see if you're capable of withstanding Hell.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
You've been testing me, huh?
Pretty cocky, for a chicken.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Chickens may be chickens, but I am a god of chickens.
I would say that I'm far more distinguished than

some eagle who's merely possessing a human.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Excuse me?
Do you have any idea who I am?

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
It's way too late for you to apologize!

I'm having fried chicken!

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I-I give in!
I bear no hostile intent towards you, truly.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
If you understand, then alright.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I just wanted to confirm that you wouldn't

find yourself in danger in Hell.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
I don't need any of your little tests.
Now, are you gonna open

the gate to Hell or not?

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Oh right, that reminds me.

I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to

trust that beast spirit possessing you.
And with that, please enjoy your time in Hell.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

You've done well to follow me.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huff, huff...
Hell's winds sure take a toll on ya.
But I finally caught up to you!
You're the beast spirit
who's trying to take over the surface!

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast
spirit you are looking for is not me.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
The beast spirits you see as your enemy,
are  not here in Hell.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Huh?
Are you trying to trick me?

What a thoughtless beast spirit.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
It's fine even if

you think I'm lying.
Choose not to believe me,

and you shall never
find your enemy

in this hopelessly large Hell.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
W-Well. I'll look into whether

you're lying after I defeat you!

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

You should've done this from the start.

If you can beat me,
I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

","Marisa (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

That aura I feel from you...
Could you be a wolf spirit?
To think that a wolf would be smart enough
to rely on a living human...

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance
with that loathsome Kiketsu family!
I shall liberate the human spirits(our prey)

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Our objectives are the same.)

Since I'm really busy ...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Even if I try to startle humans, no-one's ever surprised.
It's so boring.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Nobody would be surprised by a monster umbrella.


A normal umbrella blown around by the wind would be scarier.
It might run into you.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

I'll smash you up, boooo!

Would you take me to it?

Yes, as you can see, it's all been lost.


Most of the treasure was stolen by greedy thieves,

It was carried away by fairies.

Well, that's too bad.
However.


It looks like something more interesting than treasure is sleeping here.

What's the matter?
Why did you start talking to yourself?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Unzan tells me

you've been gathering the fragments of the floating treasure.
I guess asking the mice to find it didn't work ...

What is this secret treasure, anyway ...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Who are you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

Of the Mountain...??)

The last battle is right before our eyes!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

I see, so you're gonna go on anyway.
Do your best, 'cause remember, I'll be there to pick up your bones,
Big Sis Strong Corpse.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

Oh right, I forgot to tell you one thing.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take you down here!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

I think I'm sweating so much I'm losing weight.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(You have to take care of your own body.
It's a given for us magic users.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

Well, since I'm a thief,
I can definitely say that
there's no treasure to be found around here.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
What are you trying to find......
Miss human, which I have not seen for a long time.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Here she is!
I've got the feeling she's the big boss this time.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Oh, my, I wonder if this bird
is Satori's pet?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

......you met Miss Satori, didn't you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

(Yes, she said her pet
was responsible for the geyser.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Indeed, I'm Utsuho, the administrator of the Blazing Hell's heating power.
The geyser is merely its byproduct, but......
What's wrong with it?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I want you to stop it
'cause it's dangerous.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

......The geyser shouldn't be that dangerous.
At most, you can only get burnt by it.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Well, something is gushing out with hot water!
Vengeful spirits or something else.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Vengeful spirits......? That's weird.
Vengeful spirits should be under Orin's control.
I'm not responsible for the vengeful spirit matter.
Plus, the geyser cannot be stopped now.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
I have just obtained an exceedingly strong power,
and the flame of the Blazing Hell became stronger as a result.
So geysers became stronger as well.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Strong power?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Yes. The ultimate power
The energy to melt up every corner of the surface.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(What are you talking about?
There's no such power.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hm, that's right.
And the geyser can definitely be stopped.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Well, I sure found ya quick.
Guess I just gotta search in places
where the youkai wanna fight.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Wait a sec.
I found her first.
First come first served,
big sis.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
And why's that?
You saw her first,
but your shoddy music won't be enough...
...to defeat this tsukumogami user.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Woah.
What? There's two tsukumogami?
Perfect,
I can take down two birds with one stone!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
We certainly don't need two almighty tsukumogami.
Could you step back, please?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Hmm. Well, whatever.
I'll leave her to you, Benben.
See you later?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Hey,
no runnin' away!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Oh, that's unfortunate...
You're going to make that Hakkero(tsukumogami) cry, you know?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
The last thing it sees will be
its owner, falling out of the sky!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Ugh.
How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Man,
that was such a let-down.
I thought you were going to
give me a better fight.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
It's a bit chilly.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Hey, you!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
Have you come to exterminate me?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Hm?
Oh, yeah, I guess.
Anyway, a mermaid, huh?
Sashimi...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
Okay!
I just have to beat you and I'll gain status!
The dawn of the reign of us youkai
is coming!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Ichirin","
How splendid.
I can't believe there are humans like that in this world, too ...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
So what's this secret treasure?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
The flying treasure is my sister's most precious treasure.
You saw it too, right?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well, I saw something ...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
They're flying objects the fairies carry around sometimes.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Is she talking about those round UFOs ...?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hmmm ... 
Well, now, this is ...


This place is totally empty.
And there's totally no-one here.


Just an abandoned place that's become a fairy hangout ...
How does this thing even stay in the air?


Maybe there was some kind of accident.
It feels like a ghost ship.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Is someone there?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, guess I missed you.
Someone's onboard after all.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
And who are you?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
A magician that makes just crying kids shut up.
How about you?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Oh, where are my manners?
I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
So the captain's here!  Maybe that means this ship
isn't just floating around.


So, what'd you call this place, a holy ...?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
... ... what did you say?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Well, we'll be arriving shortly.
I won't let you get away!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
You're strong ... ...
But I think we've made up enough time.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I didn't want to run away, you know.


There's still a lot I don't know about this ship.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
I see, then I suppose it's okay for me to resume service.
We'll be arriving shortly.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh, it feels like it's easier
to use magic now for some reason.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
That's because we'll be entering Makai shortly.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
D-did you say Makai?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Yes, Hokkai is a small part of Makai,
so we need to go to Makai.
There's a miasma that's bad for your body floating about,
but it makes magic stronger.
That's why Hijiri's seal is so strong, too.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well now, I wonder who the heck
would be sealed away in a place like that?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Hmm?
So you came to Makai, too?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, it's that mouse from before!


If you're here, too,
you must have something to do with that ship.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
I heard that you had
one of the treasures I was looking for.


I've been looking for another treasure - it's a secret from the captain.


My master carelessly lost it, so she was
probably too embarrassed to tell anyone but me.


So, why don't I try
using this jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well now.


I've never seen a seal like this before.
Looks like this isn't the usual kind.


I guess you need this treasure(?) I found
to break the seal, but ...


Are these UFOs really treasure?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Yes, I've been waiting for you.


We can break the seal
with the flying treasure you've brought.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Who're you?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Satori","
......""Anyway, everything'll be fine if I beat her, right?""
I see.
......""What a pain, let's just fight.""
I see. How belligerent.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Marisa... You....)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Don't worry. Seems like
she can really read minds, though.
Right now, I'm not thinking about anything else but fighting her!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Hm, I can see it.
My mind-reading third eye will show me your very heart!
An image of battle...
I think I can use this to make you suffer.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Here I come. From now on it's the real thing!
Sleep with the trauma that always wakes you up!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
You're pretty strong,
But you didn't come here to beat me.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
If you can read minds, then there's no need to lie.
Oh, that's right! I came to discover the secrets of the geyser!
And then that oni told me to come to this mansion...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
You should have said that from the beginning.
I wouldn't have had to fight you...
... If a geyser is causing you trouble, then
it's probably my pet's doing.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Your pet?
You mean the cat we saw before?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
If you want to find out more,
I'll open the courtyard for you.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The courtyard?
Your pet is there, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
No, the courtyard has a hole that leads down
to the depths of the underworld.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, so I guess this place isn't
the last dungeon?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(We still have a long way to go. Let's go the depths of the underworld.
Hang in there.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""Before that, let's search the house...."" you think.
I won't allow that.
Please head to the courtyard immediately.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Damn.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Whew...
This is so hot. So hot I could die! 

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Okay, question time is over.
That's how it is talking to people in town.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Pretty straightforward.
Mind if I ask something?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Go ahead.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
It's really been a long time since humans came underground.
That's because there's a lot of really frightening youkai
here. Humans always seemed scared of them.
So, then, are you brave?
Or are you a fool?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I'm a merchant.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(You mean a thief, right?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Ho ho.
I guess it's a waste of time to ask a fool a question.
If you were strong, I probably wouldn't need to say anything,
No matter why you came down here.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Marisa, watch out!
I did some research, and the Big Four of the Mountain are...)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Alright, come on and fight me seriously!
If you don't, you might end up in tears!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Well done!
I love how strong you are!
We're friends from now on.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(The Big Four of the Mountain are the four
big oni, if we're talking about the Youkai Mountain.)
(Which would mean you're looking at an oni...)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
An oni...?
You mean, like Suika?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
So, why did you come down here?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I have no idea, myself...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Oh, that was certainly a point I overlooked.
If I'm no longer of this world, then the Blazing Hell will return to the way it was.
But, there's also another point you are overlooking.
My ultimate nuclear energy melts up everything completely!
How would you go about taking me down then?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The wind's pretty strong for the inside of a cave.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
(......Marisa?
Can you hear me?...)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
No, I can't hear you at all.
I'm still normal.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(... I see.
Should I take back my dolls, then?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh, so I can use them to talk to you,
not just for attacking.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Yukari prepared them for me.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh?
A human? How unusual.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Are you going to the festival they're having down below?
You look like it.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Indeed.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I'm not really interested in the underground.
I mean, we'd finally gotten a hot spring up there.
Why do I have to come to such a wet and gloomy place
all of a sudden?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(We'd be in trouble if you hadn't come.)
(After all, we can't make a move
down there.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
What are you mumbling about?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Just talking to myself about how to beat you.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
It looks like you're not that friendly of a visitor.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
See, all we've done is beat up someone completely unrelated.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Isn't that what you always do?
Just stop complaining and hurry on further down.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, I guess it is what I always do.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
How many floors to go until we're underground?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(There aren't any ""floors"" in a cave.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Really? I thought places like dungeons
always had floors.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Are the dolls okay?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yeah, but it's so hot I wouldn't be surprised if they burned up.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(I think the dolls themselves will be fine,
but it would be bad if the gunpowder inside caught fire.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Why the hell did you stuff gunpowder in 'em?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
......it's that cat again.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Marisa, are you throwing around some kind of cat food?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Maybe it wants to play with these dolls?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Tada~
Sis, you're pretty strong.
You even beat Miss Satori.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Ooh, here she comes!
A boss, out of the blue.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(It wasn't exactly out of the blue, actually......)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
So, sis, you're investigating the geyser, right?
I saw ya goin' back and forth with Miss Satori!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
That must have been the last dungeon's mid-boss, I guess.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(No, she said the geyser was her pet's doing.)
(Is this girl the last boss?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Too bad!
The geyser's not my territory.
I just followed you because you're strong.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
She said it's not her.
Why don't we go? I'm wasting my energy, here.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Well,
I wonder what kind of youkai she is...)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Leave your corpses and vengeful spirits to me!
Shipping dead bodies to hell, Orin's wheelbarrow transport at your service.
In this Blazing Hell, we'll grow your corpse and spirit
into a really great vengeful spirit!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Aww, you sure did it, sis.
I'm really moved!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Vengeful spirits?
We don't hear about them often, do we?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
There aren't many vengeful spirits on the surface.
How are they different from phantoms?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
A vengeful spirit is a ghost that came into being because of a grudge.
If one possesses a human or a youkai,
the possessed will come to hold a grudge against the world.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Will come to hold a grudge against world?
Then, maybe the geyser incident...)
(And my dolls going crazy near the geyser is
... because of the vengeful spirits?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Vengeful spirits are coming from the geyser, right?
If that's the case, then I'm satisfied with this explanation.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
That's dangerous.
So, let's depart on an adventure to stop the geyser!
Oops, it's already the last stage.
Never mind that excitement, then.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Sis, you're going to stop the geyser, right?
You'd better give up.
The one that controls geysers is deadly.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
And here the last dungeon comes to a finale.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(That's right, are you prepared for it?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Ah, I should have done some shopping in the town back there.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(But, it doesn't look like there are any townsfolk here.
......There was a cat, though.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
It's all good. Searching a house with nobody in it is
the basic of basics.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
......Who is it?
A human......?
I can't believe a human could make it all the way down here.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
It's all good. Searching a house with somebody in it is also
the basic of basics.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Why don't you listen to what she has to say?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Aah, well, I want the hot spring to gush more.
What should I do?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
...What you are saying is the opposite of
what you are thinking.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Now you're starting to have questions about the gushing hot spring.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What do you mean...?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I'm Satori, the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
No one can hide anything from me.
Your heart is in plain sight to me.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
......Huh?
What the heck?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(......A satori!
She's a youkai exiled from the surface.)
(She has an extremely dangerous ability, mind reading.
There's no way you can win.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yuck, I don't like this.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(I can't believe we were led here just by
investigating that geyser.)
(Perhaps the oni back there
tricked us?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I didn't think oni were such liars, though...
Maybe she knows something?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
...""Mind reading, that sounds like a lie.""

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh?!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
You're pretty interesting.
I like you, let's play!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Okay,
good luck~)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, now.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
See? You provoked her, and I had to fight
an unnecessary battle.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(But, they're always
dirtying up our rivers...) 

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
This is gonna be a long trip.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I wonder how far down this hole goes...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Just a little farther until the Former Capital.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Former Capital?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(It's where some old friends of ours live.
It's a great underground city.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What's that?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Are you a human?
What does a human want in the Former Capital?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, uh, well,
Nothing in particular, I think.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Did you get lost?
You'd better go back above ground if so.
Back to where the light is so dazzling...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(But everyone with really nasty powers
is forced to live outside the city.)
(This is a youkai who controls jealousy.
Beat her up good now, okay?)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, ah...
It's not like I mind beating her, but...
It's kind of hard to have a conversation that way.
Why am I even down here in the first place?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Because of the hot springs, right?
If you want to find hot springs, you've gotta go underground.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
You talk to yourself an awful lot.
Well, I'm sure nobody will mind terribly much
if I just beat up one person...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I have no idea what's going on, but if there's gonna be hot springs, I don't care!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Okay, we're almost to the Former Capital!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What kind of youkai live in the Former Capital?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Youkai that were sealed away out of revulsion,
youkai that exiled themselves underground of their own accord...)
(There's some loud, anti-social types,
and...)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Suddenly I don't think I want to go there anymore.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hey, you're pretty good.
No idea who you are, but they say
a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so
Keep following until you can't take anymore!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(I don't think she knows
what troublesome company she's taking up...)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What's that?
Is this one of those vile, hated youkai?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(......)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"

What's wrong?
Giving up already?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Well, hello, I didn't think we'd
stumble across someone like you...)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?
You know her?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(She's an oni, and they're boss of us kappa and the tengu.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
What's that?
I thought you were talking to yourself, but it's really those orbs, isn't it?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(The tengu and the kappa have only been in charge
of the mountain since the oni have been gone.)
(Well, they've been gone for such a long time,
and everything's been peaceful since, but...)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
But isn't there an oni in Gensokyo already?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(I've got something to ask you.
I'd like you to stop the geyser that's erupting now.)
(I can feel something sinister behind
it all. Above all...)
(My dolls go out of control when they get near it.
It's as if they've got some sort of grudge...)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
A geyser, huh?
That's odd, I have no idea about that either...
You should probably go to the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
They might know something up there.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, you're finally acting like a townsperson.
But...
What's with you, Alice? You sent me down here
to try to stop the hot springs?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(That's right.  I thought you'd object
if I mentioned it, so I didn't tell you.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, I guess if I've come this far, I'll go to that
Palace of the Earth Spirits or whatever and make those springs gush forth!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Wow, it's true!
She can read my mind.
How can I beat someone like that?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Just clear your mind and fight her.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I- I guess.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
You know, even if you keep chanting
""clear your mind, clear your mind""...
Well, it's been so long since I've seen
a human, so we may as well fight a bit.
You have such beautiful danmaku in your heart.
With those beautiful danmaku, I'll chase you
back up to your lukewarm above ground world!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Now, this is where it really begins!
Go and sleep with a trauma so frightful, it'll wake you up!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
You're quite strong, aren't you?
It's nice to fight with humans.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(... oh, those were my danmaku.
They were ever so slightly different, though.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Pretty weird to fight the danmaku that
just happen to come to mind...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Now, what was it that you wanted?
...... oh, yes, the geyser.
I'll take you to the courtyard.
There's a hole there that will lead you to the deepest part of the underground.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Okay.
Oh yeah, Nitori, I still wanna know what you're up to.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(... oh, right. I'm interested in the youkai
at the base of the geyser.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The youkai at the base of the geyser?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Well, it doesn't have anything to do with you.
It's personal business!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I just don't get what you're saying. I thought
we were going to make off with equal shares.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""But any treasure I find is all mine.""
I'd watch out, Miss Kappa inside the orbs.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Uhyo!
Moving right along now...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take you down here!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Man, the farther I go, the hotter it gets!
Is this heat power what you're after?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(They say that this power makes
it hotter and high pressure.)
(They say it's the ultimate,
final energy.)
(This heat is nowhere close.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
At this rate, I'm really going to burn up...

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I heard about you from Orin.
She told me a human came to see
how magnificent my power was.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(She's heeeeere?
It's her, it's her!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, I'm glad you're having fun.
Are you drinking, or something?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Well, I'm the first one to see
this power the kappa heard of.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Ohoho, so they're even talking about
me up above ground? I'm so happy.
But, how did you find out about me?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(The god of the mountain told us about you,
and said it would advance our state of the art.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
What? Why did the god of the mountain...?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Sorry to cut in just as it's getting good,
but just what is your power, anyway?
How will it make the kappa more advanced?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
I've gained the power of a certain god.
The Black Sun, Lord Yatagarasu.
It's the same as the power of the sun.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What's the power of the sun?
Photosynthesis? Sunburn?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(You're such an idiot.
How can a magician be so ignorant?)
(It's solar energy.
A super high temperature, high pressure world.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
It's fusion energy.
Nuclear energy creates an almost everlasting,
super high temperature power; this is Lord Yatagarasu's power.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Because nuclear fusion requires such high temperatures,
it's supposed to be hard to control, but...)
(This crow here can do it.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
That's amazing.
The same power as the sun. I want it, too!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Don't you?)
(So, Marisa,
make sure you take her alive!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Wait, are you serious!?
She controls ultimate heat, you know?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Each person who could would control fusion energy differently.
What would you do with it if you could steal it away?
The ultimate vehicle? The ultimate weapon?
Or, maybe, the ultimate magic?
Well, I want to revive the Blazing Hell.
I'll melt the Earth away!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
But enough of that, it's my turn now.
So, why don't you let us pass?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
I wonder who's really behind those orbs...
But first, if it's a fight you want, then it's a fight you'll get!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Well done!
You're pretty mysterious, but you're really strong,
so you can't be that bad.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Alright, let's just get going now.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, do you know where we're going?
I don't have the slightest clue, you know.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Well, if we want to find the hot springs,
we've got to find whoever's making that geyser.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?
So you're looking for the hot springs, too?
I guess I can see a kappa sitting in a hot springs
and drinking sake.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
So, the voice in those orbs...
Is a kappa's voice?
Heeey, can you hear me?
You kappa in there!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Bwuh!?)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
I bet it's peaceful and fun up in the mountain, right?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Yes, yes, same as always.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Don't worry.
I'm not going to try to take over the mountain again or anything.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Be careful.
The youkai underground are different from us.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(...... I hope you'll at least come
up and go drinking with us sometime.)
(Even though we're all pretty busy...)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hm, that person who's making the geyser...
Will we meet them in this mansion?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(There should be more to the underground than just the Former Capital.)
(There has to be a way for us
to go even deeper.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
You sure know a lot.
Are you hiding something from me?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(You can tell the heat is coming from
beneath this mansion.)
(It looks like there's a hole somewhere
where we can go down.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hm, do you know something I don't? 
Oh well, if you're house hunting I dont mind helping.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
...... a visitor?
Are you a human?
No, you wouldn't have been able to make it this far.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, we've been found by a member of the household.
Now I'm going to have to silence her!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The wind's pretty strong for the inside of a cave.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
(...... heeey, can you hear me?)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
... maybe I can, and maybe I can't.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(... I know you can hear me, it's me.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I can't see you, ""It's me."" isn't enough for me to tell who you are.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh?
A human? How unusual.
Are you going to the festival they're having down below?
You look like it.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Here she is! It's a spider, an earth spider!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Spider...?
Really?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Oh, looks like the cat's out of the bag.
Just when I thought I'd finally got myself some wild game.
You're no ordinary person, are you?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Yah, an earth spider!
We'll tear you to pieces!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Good luck~
She looks kind of strong, though.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Are you ready to sleep in the depths of hell?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
...... you're quite belligerent.
How foolish.
...... a geyser? A hole that will lead you underground?
Why are you looking for something like that?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?
Did I say something?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
You want a hot spring, don't you?
So you're pretending to cooperate with the kappa.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Hah?)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
......
Who are you?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I'm Satori, master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
I can tell everything you're thinking.
My third eye shows me... Miss Marisa.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What?
I still haven't said anything.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Hey, just beat her up already.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh, huuh? Well, okay.
I guess I'll just have to beat her and search the house.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""She can read my mind?
That has to be some kind of trick.""
""If that's true, she can tell what I'm about to think.""
""Kappappa-, kappappa-,
taking a big bite out of Kyuuchan cucumber-"" 

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hahaha, you didn't want to get caught by the boss,
so you sent me down here instead?
Oh, man, this is hilarious.
All I have to do is beat her, right?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
...... what are you going on about?
It looks like those orbs know about me, though.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Yeah, but we're no match for her even if she's alone.
I don't want to think about if all the oni came back.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Indeed, I am one of the Big Four of the Mountain, Yuugi the strong.
However, I haven't been able to go the the mountains
since I've come underground.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Please, tell her to just stay there and not
come back above ground.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Man, it's so hot!
What is this place?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(This place...?
It looks like this is a real hell.)
(Ho ho ho,
I can see it, I can see it?)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Must be nice not to have to
experience all this heat.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
...... it's that cat again.
Hey, Nitori, maybe your orbs smell like fish?
It's attracting this cat.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Do they?
*sniff sniff*)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Tada~
They don't really smell like fish to me.
All I can smell is human corpses!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?
The cat got big... wait.
Did you say the smell of corpses?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Yep, the smell of strong human's corpses.
Corpses that'll be worth carrying off!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(What's with her?
She's kind of unsettling.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
I heard you at Miss Satori's place.
You're looking for the youkai at the base of the geyser, right?
But, ya can't stop her.
She's the worst bird there is.
You may be pretty strong,
but she's really dangerous!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(The worst bird...?
That's it! We should go meet her, Marisa.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?
Is someone telling you what to do?
I don't know what you're after,
but I can smell treasure in it.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Okay. If you can get your hands on my
target, I'll share some of it with you.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, that was easy.
All right, it's settled, off we go!

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Hey, hey, hey, Sister Strong Corpse.
Where ya goin'?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Sorry, I don't have to to play around with cats.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Oh, it's so wonderful
to see someone rushing to their death.
Your corpse and soul look pretty strong, Sis.
I bet they'll make my cart pretty heavy.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
That's wonderful!
You're so strong I was moved.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(Okay, let's go, let's go!
The power I want is almost at hand!)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What kind of power is that?

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Nitori","
(They say it's many times
more powerful than electricity.)
(It'll revolutionize all
our power production methods.)

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Are you talking about her power?
Is that what you're after, Sis?
Hahahahaha, oh, this'll be fun.
I guess I didn't have to try to stop you.
Just between you and me,
her power is the power of the gods.
We animals of the deep get more powerful
by eating ghosts and spirits, but..
Somehow she was able to swallow up a god.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I see.
I don't really get it, but...
Maybe she can help me with my
magical research, too.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Oh right, I forgot to tell you one thing.

","Marisa_and_Nitori","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Oh?
A human? How unusual.
Are you going to the festival they're having down below?
You look like it.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Well, what's the matter?
Aren't you off to stop the geyser?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I don't feel comfortable with someone who can read my mind around.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I can see it...
My mind-reading third eye will show me your very heart!
The beautiful danmaku in your heart
will make you suffer!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Here's where it really begins!
Now, sleep with this trauma that will leave you sleepless!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Hm, you're quite strong.
It's good to attack humans.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...... Now, I'd like you to
take us to that pet you mentioned before.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Very well.
However...
I haven't seen this particular pet in quite some time,
so I don't know what sort of youkai she's grown up to be.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What kind of master are you?
It pisses me off how many irresponsible pet owners there are these days.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
My pets take care of themselves by absorbing
various spirits and youkai.
Letting them run free is the best way to keep my stress down.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(That cat we met before was probably running free...
Just like our cat.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh, you have a cat?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...... maybe that was a human we had.
It's within the margin of error.) 

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
Well, I'll take you to the courtyard.
There's a hole there that leads to the deepest parts of the underground.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Heading down again?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
It sure is hot in this courtyard.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(It's not supposed to be hot in the courtyard.)
(You're hot because you're wearing those heavy clothes.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yeah, I sure am.
This is what I wear in winter, you know.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
...... it's a cat.
I wonder if cats love me now?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...... a black cat in the flames of hell. What a bad omen.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Tada~
Hey, sis, you're pretty good?
Your strength is growing on me!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What!
The cat turned into a person!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(A cat and a person... within the margin of error.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Oh yeah, sis, you wanted to find out about that geyser, right?
I heard you talkin' about it before!
You'd better give up. You'd better give up.
Ya hafta meet the worst bird ever to stop the geyser.
If she touches you, you'll melt right away,
and looking in her eyes will drive you mad!
And now she's so dazzling you can't see a thing.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
But, uh, Patchouli...
What now?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(You can only keep going, right?
Right on past her.)
(If you can't stop the geyser,
then something worse will happen.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Guess I have no choice...
But you're just watching from up there.
It's really hot down here.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(I'm not just watching.
I'm drinking tea while watching.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Hey, sis, you wanna keep going?
Or you gonna turn back?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I don't wanna keep going!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Aw, you don't wanna keep going?
Great!
I'll be sure to be careful with
your strong corpse and spirit when you're dead!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What?
They look about the same...

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
Well, if you're gonna go, go, or else go back.
It'll be harder for you if I have to get involved.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(The youkai underground are bad for you.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Whaat?
It's not like I'm going to eat her?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yamame","
I'm bad for you even if you don't eat me.
Well, I haven't punished a human with diseases in a long time,
I may as well have some fun.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Wow, you're right.
She seems pretty bad for me.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(The underground is full of despised youkai.
You'd better be ready for them.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Is that why you didn't come down here yourself and sent me instead?
That's not fair.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
So, the youkai underground are bad for me?
It seems like the underground itself is pretty bad for me.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(I read up on that youkai we ran across before.)
(It was an earth spider.
A troublesome youkai who inflicts disease upon humans.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Disease?  Give me a break.
So, can you tell what their weak points are, too?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Are you a human?
Have humans come to explore the underground?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, yes!
That's exactly it.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Please, take my advice,
you're better off just going right back where you came.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I don't feel like going back, though.
So, what can you tell me about this one?
What's her power, or her weak point?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
It seems there's almost no information in your heart
about the geyser.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What are you saying?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...)
(Wait a moment,
I've got a bad feeling about this.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
......
Who are you?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I'm Satori, the master of this household.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(What!?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
You seem human,
what need do you have of me?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Well, you know, the geyser...
What do I do now?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...... ask her how to stop the geyser.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
But I don't really want to stop it...
Well, is there any way I can?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
How to stop the geyser, you say...
I'm sure one of my pets would be able to do that.
Hm,

""I want to meet her and have her make more hot springs""?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Eh?
What?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""How did she figure out what I was thinking"",
you say...

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Marisa, she's more than you can handle.
Hurry up and go find her pet.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
I didn't give you permission to do that.
Just how do you intend to go find her?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?
I'll just find her, somehow.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Satori","
""This sucks, maybe I should have asked her how I can
beat this creep...""

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, how can you tell what I'm thinking?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
The wind's pretty strong for the inside of a cave.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
(...... that's because this great
wind hole is here.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
...... hm, my ears are ringing.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(... you can hear
my voice, right?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What's that?
Where's your voice coming from?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(How should I know that already?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Well, I tried to warn you...
Humans truly are foolish.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Well, you're the one that provoked her,
deal with her yourself.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Guess I have to.
Well, please look up how to beat her while I beat her, okay?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh, looks like I beat her.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(... a Persian person driven by jealousy?
I don't really understand.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Why is a Persian underground?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Look, this is all conjecture.
*scribbles notes*)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hm. Why do I feel like I'm down here

to conduct research on underground youkai?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hey, you're pretty good.
No idea who you are, but they say
a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so
Keep following until you can't take anymore!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh?
I don't really want to follow you, but...

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Man,
what's with her?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(I read up on that youkai we ran across before.)
(It was a bridge princess.
A youkai driven mad by jealousy, sworn to protect the bridge.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, why not worry about this youkai that's here now instead?
Read up on her, please!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
What, are you out of breath?
Giving up already?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...... I can't conduct research that quickly!)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
You're so useless.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
What's wrong?
Are you trying to figure out who I am?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey! You got it, you're pretty good.
That's it, now just tell me your weak point, please.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
I'm one of the Big Four of the Mountain, Yuugi the strong.
My weak point is fried beans, obviously.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh, I wish they'd all been this cooperative.
Too bad I don't have any fried beans on me.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...
Her weak point is fried beans?)
(Fried beans...
No way.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
So, why did you come all the way down here?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh, you know, I have no idea myself.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(This place isn't our destination.
Get rid of this pest so we can keep going.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
You're pretty violent.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Yes, indeed.
I love violent people.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
But, if you're all talk, then you'll die here!
I shall test your strength!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
Well done!
I expected nothing less from someone who made it
all the way down here on their own.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...Well, let's move on.
Let's just... leave her alone.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
... You know where we're supposed to go?
I have no idea where we even are.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
This place is Former Hell,
a prison the youkai from above can't interfere with.
You beat me.
I'll lead you wherever you want, if you wish.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(... okay, then please take us to wherever the person
who's creating the geyser is.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Yuugi","
A geyser...
Okay, why don't you try going to the Palace of the Earth Spirits up ahead?
It might be hard for a human...
Well, it looks like you'll be strong enough.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Just strong enough to beat you, that's nothing to write home about.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Look at her, while she was fighting us and drinking,
she didn't spill a drop of her sake.)
(And she hates fried beans.
...... you were just testing us, weren't you?)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
What a weird mansion.
The ground is so shiny, it's weird.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(I wonder...
if the person that made the geyser is here.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh yeah, what about the geyser?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(From all those little things around you...)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
I told you, I don't need to know about youkai after I've already beat them.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell ya something.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
It keeps getting hotter the farther I go!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(That's to be expected.
If you climb a mountain, the temperature falls.)
(Contrarily, the further underground you go, the higher the temperature is.
It's an easy enough conclusion to come to.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
But it was cold and snowy in that city before.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I found you!
Orin told you about me.
You want to stop the geyser, right?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Here she is!
Don't stop the geyser!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Please stop the geyser.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
What about the geyser, now?
Why do I have to stop it?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh yeah, why does she have to stop it?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(...... that geyser is a path for vengeful spirits
to come above ground.)
(Vengeful spirits are gushing out of it even
as we speak.)
(The spirits will possess any living thing, no, even non-living
things and create ill will.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
Vengeful spirits...?
Vengeful spirits from the geyser?
What a weird story. I don't know anything about any vengeful spirits.
They should be Orin's territory...

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(It doesn't matter, they're coming out!
So, just stop the geyser.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hmmm.
You should have told me that from the beginning.
I'll beat her and stop the geyser,
and we'll feast on bird tonight!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
No.
I don't know everything about what's going on, but...
I don't care about sending any spirits in.
I wanted to go see above ground for myself...

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Utsuho","
And then I'll melt it all away with my atomic fire.
Are you strong enough to fight in the preliminaries?
Do you have a power that can match nuclear fusion!?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Satori... I've heard of those before.
They're said to be the most hated of the youkai underground.)
(A youkai that can read your heart. They can
use their power to control the wordless spirits...)
(And only wordless animals love them.
The animals grow up to become powerful youkai.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
......

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
Man, you're really strong.
It's really touching!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Marisa,
aren't you going any further?)
(You have to go steal lots of
books from people's houses.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Guess I gotta...
Just this once!
So, what about the geyser?
How can we stop her?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Rin","
You're going, right? You're going, right?
I won't stop ya.
Man, I'm so happy.
There's no way she could do in
a corpse as strong as you!

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, I'm still alive.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Ah, I've found it.
She's a type of youkai called a kasha...)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(We have to stop it.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Really?
I don't really get it.
Besides,
There's only cats and fairies in this mansion.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
... A visitor?
Are you human?
No, you wouldn't be able to get this far.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hm, there she is.
Looks like a member of the household.

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Patchouli","
(Uh, hurry up and ask her about the geyser.)

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Um, excuse me?
I want to ask you about the geyser...

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
... geyser?
......
...... you really want to know about that?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa_and_Patchouli","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Reimu","
You're a target?
Now that is a surprise. 

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Cirno","
Quit teasing me!
I'll deep-freeze you with some
English beef!!

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Ah, it's gotten chilly out.
I'll catch an air conditioner cold at this rate.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Didn't you hire that maid
to protect you?
I can take a sheltered girl like you
down in one blow!

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Sakuya is an excellent cleaner.
Not a single head is on the floor, thanks to her.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Are you strong?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Who knows.
I don't get to go outside often.
Since I'm weak to sunlight.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
...
So you're strong, then.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
The moon is so red tonight...
I will end your life for real.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
The moon is so red, but...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia_and_Reimu","
Looks like it's going to be a fun night.
Looks like it's going to be a long night.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Ask the mistress yourself.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Then call her here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
And why would I place the mistress
in danger?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Will she come
if I cause trouble here?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
You've already caused enough.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Even so, you cannot meet with
my mistress.
I can stall you for as long as it takes by stopping time.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
How's that!?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Why are you so full of yourself, at this level?
You have a long way to go.
Come back two hours earlier.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Now I wonder if you'll let me meet with the mistress.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
She's strong...
But maybe the mistress can...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
I've got to at least make you waste a bomb
before the mistress gets mad at me...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Can't you be quiet and go run some errands?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Isn't it about time you
showed yourself?
""Mistress""?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
I knew it. Humans are useless.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Clownpiece","
So you are in league with the moon's people!
Which means you're an enemy of our honorable friend.
An enemy of honorable friend is an enemy of Master's.
And any enemy of Master's is an enemy of mine!
...but, I'm not really sure what to do.
I've got no fight left in me.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
For starters, how about you guide
me to this... friend?
I've sort of lost track
of my actual goal, here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
No matter how many countermeasures
I work out, you overcome them.
'Tis a shame.
My nemesis was nearly within reach.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
You're the ringleader of the invasion
of the Lunar Capital, huh?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
For now, I shall admit defeat.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Wha?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
You'll have to go and
work things out on your own.
Now, to the Lunar Capital(Lunatic Kingdom)!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
The moon is so close...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Well, look who it is.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
If it isn't Gensokyo's shrine maiden.
This is quite a powerful nightmare, isn't it?
...Wait.
Your physical body!?
Is that your physical body?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Uh...
I suppose it is?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
For not one moment did I ever expect
that they would send an earthling to the moon.
I'm surprised that the people of the moon, hating even the
slightest impurity, would use such a haphazard method.
I underestimated them.
The battle has already been decided.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
You seem real relaxed, even though
the fight is still to come.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.
If I may be frank, my current will to fight has vanished...
However, I shall at least show you
some hospitality for arriving here.
It is only polite, is it not?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
To be honest, I don't really care
one bit about the Lunar Capital...
But I've got to at least vent a little
about having been given so much trouble!
Plus, you're sort of annoying somehow.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Though she now lives on another heavenly body,
and I am unable to meet with her...
Even if we are unable to dwell together under Heaven,
my hatred alone will be refined.
Now, show me!
Just what an earthling risking her life is capable of!
And behold!
This pristine spiritual force that rejects life and death!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
No matter how many countermeasures
I work out, you overcome them.
However, it seems your foolish
scheme has ended in failure.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
You're the ringleader of the invasion
of the Lunar Capital, right?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Verily.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
All right! I dunno what's going on, but I'm
gonna beat you and save the Lunar Capital!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
The people of the moon escape into a dream,
and send an earthling to deal with me.
I thought it to be a daring plan,
but I suppose I overestimated them.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Huh...?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
A human so completely surrounded by the
stench of death can never hope to defeat me.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
My name is Junko.
With my power of purification,
I am able to kill you unconditionally.
Just how many mistakes have you
suffered on the way here?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Guh.
It shouldn't have been that many...
(That reminds me. Eirin did say that I couldn't
defeat these enemies without her drug...
The side effects sounded kinda scary,
though, so I wound up not using it.)

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Was that maid really human?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
You. You're the murderer.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Don't worry, it was only one person,
so it's not like I'm a serial killer.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
Well?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Oh right, you're being a huge
nuisance.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
How quick you are to accuse. And I don't even know why.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Whatever, could you
just leave?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
This is my castle, is it not?
You are the one who will leave.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I want you to leave this world.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Remilia","
So that's how it's going to be.
I am already full, but...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
There is someone in the mansion who likes to mess
with space.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Ah, the cleaning isn't getting anywhere!
The mistress will be angry with me!!

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
You're getting in the way of my cleaning again...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
You...
don't seem to be the owner.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
What is it?
Are you a guest of the mistress?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
(She probably won't let me pass if I tell her
that I came to defeat her mistress.)

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
You may not pass.
The mistress rarely meets
with people.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Is she under house arrest?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
My mistress likes dark places.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Then a not-so-dark person like you will do.
You're the ones spreading this mist
all over the place, right?
It's a nuisance.
What are you trying to do?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Sakuya","
Daylight is bothersome.
The mistress prefers the dark.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
But I don't.
Would you stop it?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
It sure feels great out.
There aren't many evil spirits about
during the day, so I'm trying my luck at night...
But it's dark out, and
I'm not sure where to go.
Still...
It's so romantic out behind the shrine at night.
(? carefree)

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
You said it!
Monsters come out too, so it's simply wonderful.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Um,
who are you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Rumia","
We just meet a few moments ago.
Could you be night-blind?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Humans can't see very well
in the dark in the first place.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Rumia","
Oh? I feel like I've seen people
who only work at night.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I have no problem with you

grabbing them and eating them for dinner.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Rumia","
Ohhhh...Is that soooo...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
You know, you're in my way.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Rumia","
Is the person in front of me the edible kind?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Have you ever heard the saying
""good medicine tastes bad""?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Of course, you wouldn't know if it's good medicine or not
unless you drank it for yourself.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Was this lake always this big?
This mist is annoying. I can't see through it.
Maybe I just have a bad sense of direction?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Cirno","
When you lose your way, it's because of the fairies.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Oh, really? Could you show me the way, then?
There was an island around here, right?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Cirno","
Hey, be a bit more surprised.
Can't you see I'm your attacker?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
It's been a while since my last job.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Damn. Time for my last stand combat formation!

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Hey, hello!
Who ARE you two?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Heh! Why, I'm Mai Teireida.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
And I'm Satono Nishida.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Hello once again,
and welcome to the Land of the Back Door (Ushirodo-no-Kuni) .

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Now, this might be a bit sudden,
but let's start your test!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Test?
What are you even talking about?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Now, if you're too weak, our
Master will get real mad at us...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
Oh?

Then, how about I kick up a storm?!
My blood's totally boiling

with midsummer heat!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
I surrenderrrr.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Whew. You were tougher than I thought.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
I didn't think I had that much strength

in me either!
This blue summer sky got me pumped up.
Right now, I feel like I could even

become the god of the new world!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
I see...
It doesn't seem like a coincidence that the fairies

are going nuts at the same time as the weather.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
What?
This here's s'posedta' be my territory.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Wha?

Territory?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Yeah. Outsiders like yourself

shouldn't be bargin' on in here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
""Territory""... I thought this area was

under tengu administration, but...
You sure don't look like a tengu.

Who are you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Who am I? Ain't nobody's problem.
If you stick around here any longer, you're

just gonna wind up as my winter food supply.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Y'sure are strong!

Who are ya, anyway?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Er, well, ahem. I work as the shrine maiden

of the Hakurei Shrine.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Shrine maiden?

Feh. First I've heard of ya.
I can't help but like strong folks, though!

Wanna come by my place?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Aha, I've heard of you before.
Living alone in the mountains...
There's these super-isolated youkai whose lifestyle is unknown,

and who forgo forming societies or any connections with others.
You're a yamanba, aren't you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Nemuno","
Yeah, I've been called that a couple a' times.
The autumn sun sets as quick as a well-bucket droppin' now.
It's gonna get freezin' cold up here on the mountain.

You should drop by an' have some tea! C'mon, don't be shy.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
I'm afraid I'll have to pass.

I'm still planning to have a long life, after all...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Now that I take a good look at it...
The sky above my shrine is in quite the state, too.
I did think it was a little spring-y around here,

but this... is definitely abnormal.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Oh?

Is there a fight going on down at the shrine?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
I've been keeping watch over this place,
but the excited fairies are all that's come by.
There haven't been any dangerous

intruders in particular.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Uhhhh.

Who are you again...?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Aw, come on!

I'm Komano the komainu, of course!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
...Did we have any komainu here?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Why, yes! I quietly keep watch over

shrines, temples, and the like.
As such,

I've been watching over this shrine too.
There's been no sign of any intruders,

so you can rest easy if you feel like heading back out.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
So you'd better give us all you've got!
If you die, welp, that's the end of that!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
What, you? A fairy?
Do you have any idea who I am?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Noooo idea.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
I'm the Hakurei shrine maiden
who silences crying children!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Well, I'm not gonna cry.
I'm a hell fairy, right?
If I had to say, I think I'd be the
one making people cry, y'know~?
Ooh, I got a good idea just now.
How about I make you cry and silence you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Hah, hah, hah...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Game set, already!
You lost!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
W-why...?
But I heard that as long as we fairies,
symbols of life, controlled this place,
the people of the moon wouldn't
be able to do a thing.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
That reminds me. The lady from before...
...mentioned ""a method that
renders us unable to act,"" too.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Hey, lady...
uh, I mean, madam? Who exactly are you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
For your physical body to break into
the Dream World like this...
...have you been caught in some kind of trap?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
T-trap?
I was heading towards the Lunar Capital...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
The Lunar Capital...
Oh-ho, I see now.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
Very well.
I will dispose of this lunatic dream.
Now, sleep.
I will craft your Kaian now.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
I've disposed of
all the nightmares up to this point.
You must have a strong will
to maintain control over your body through this.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
What are you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
I am a baku.
A resident of this Dream World.
You said you were heading towards the Lunar Capital?
And with your physical body, too.
There, a nightmare unlike any you have
encountered before now awaits you.
It is worthy of being called
a 'lunatic dream'.
Prepare yourself well,
dreaming human of the physical world.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
...I don't really get it, but...
...I guess the Lunar Capital and Gensokyo are connected
through the dream world?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Is this the Lunar Capital...?
It seems really different than the last time I came here.
Almost like the whole city
has been frozen or something.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Uhhh.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...ah, a human?
...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Can you not talk!?
Look, I'm not sure what's going on
here in the Capital,
but you're the one conducting the
invasion of Gensokyo, aren't you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
That was pretty weak, for a god. I wonder
if my shrine's god is any stronger?
Well, this is no time for baking sweet potatoes.
Better hurry on ahead.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I've been feeling awful all this while...
The atmosphere is so heavy...
It's just noon, but the sun doesn't shine here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Oh, are you still there?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
And I was trying to chase you away just now...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
When?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Oh, never mind, it doesn't matter.
My job is chasing away lost humans.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
But I'm not lost.
I just want to go to the mountain.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
I'm Nitori Kawashiro.
They call me Nitori the Valley Kappa.
Go on now, better get back to the village.
There's lots of folks who don't like humans up ahead.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Oh, I know that.
But sometimes there are things you just have to do.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
You're going to set up a formation all by yourself?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
Stop following meeee.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Thanks for showing me the wayyyy.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
You know, you can follow me all you want,
but there's nothing over there.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
You wouldn't flee to the middle of nowhere, right?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
Well, if I was running away,
I probably wouldn't be picky about where.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
By the way, who are you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
Er, just a normal person.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
But didn't you attack me before?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
I attacked normally.
But you attacked me first.
You're the one who's abnormal.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I'm just a normal person who works as a shrine maiden.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
That's good to hear.
If I remember correctly...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
...they say that shrine maidens
are the kind of human it's okay to eat...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Don't spread sayings like that!

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Well then, I'll have you show me the way.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
There's no more past this.
Since this is the demo.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Oh well, that's too bad.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Well then, I'll have you show me the way.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Meiling","
I'm so sorry, mistress...

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Aren't there any windows in this house?
And did it even look this big
from the outside?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"???","
You, the red-white one!
There is no rampaging around in my study.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Study? (Red-white?)

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
The books here are worth all the donations
your shrine has received in the past five years.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
My shrine gets no visitors all year round.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Oh. Then I suppose they're not worth much.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Anyway, can you actually read
in such a dark room?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Unlike you,
I'm not night-blind.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I'm telling youuuu,
I'm not night-blind.
...Right, so what I meant to say was,
are you the owner of this house?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
What do you need from the mistress?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
There's too much mist outside. It's a problem.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
Then I absolutely cannot allow you to
see the mistress.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
I won't let you stop me.

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Patchouli","
...By the way, just who are you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
But really, did the mansion look
this big from the outside?

","Reimu","Scenario","Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"
"Reimu","
Wait, for real?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
For really real!
It's not our fault.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
C-Come on! That's
totally ridiculous!
Ugh, I was so sure I'd
caught the culprit...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
See, we can draw out a target's latent abilities to
an infinite extent by dancing behind their backs.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
We received orders to seek out potential
in people who are normally hidden...
And to capture any aggressive
talented folks such as yourself.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
The season incident was caused by the fairies, sprites and
divine spirits who went berserk because of our dancing.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
...hmm, uh...?
Well, so, then the season incident was
indirectly your fault anyway, wasn't it.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Are you sure about that~?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
We're not gonna hold anything back,
but if you go and die on us, you're totally dead meat!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
There! I won!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
That was alright.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Yeahhh.
Passing marks, I guess?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Alright, congrats!
You paaaaassed!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Geeze, what's with you two? What a couple of pests.
You're all beat up, and still...
You two caused the incident, right?
I'm here to put a stop to it!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
You mean the 'four seasons' incident?
Nah, that wasn't us.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Sagume","
Mm. Well, that's true...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
You confessed.
You confessed so easily.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...just what is your role here?
...whoops.
If I talk too much, it'll ruin the plan.
......

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Clamming up again, huh?
Fine. There's only one thing for me to do.
Time to beat you up
and resolve this incident!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
I now understand why
you were sent here.
I'm sure it was on Lady Yagokoro's suggestion.
You're terribly strong.
Perhaps with you...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Looks like attacking you
got you to talk real fast.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
My name is Sagume.
I have the power to change the direction
of the world with my words.
So when things are going well,
I can't talk too much.
""Least said, soonest mended,"" after all.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Huh. Okay, but if you're talking all of a sudden...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
A new development will surely occur soon,
through terribly destructive means.
I'm throwing my lot in with you.
You'll be the destroyer.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
The moon's people, too, have committed a foolish mistake.
It seems this earthling is far
more weak than you all thought.
My stagnated engagement with the people of the moon
was just beginning to exhaust my interest.
My mortal enemy, Chang'e. Are you watching!?
Gaze upon this poor soul as she struggles between life and death!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
What is this?
They aren't usually this intense.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Even if you're not in the way,
I'll shoot!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
This is Seiran.
I've made contact with a belligerent earthling.
Now proceeding with purification.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Talking to yourself?
Creepy.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Too bad for you,
filthy earthling.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Earth(This place) is about
to be purified!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Ghhh...
This is why I didn't want to be in the ground troops?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Wait, are you
a moon rabbit?
Purifying the Earth...
I've got a really bad feeling about this.
Tell me where your base is!
Or else...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Please, spare me!
If I tell, they'll kill me!
If I tell you about our forward base on the mountain lake,
they'll kill me!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
So this is the moon rabbit from before's
base, huh...?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
I've been waiting for you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
I heard about you from Seiran.
She said she'd engaged an interesting person...
Huh?
I feel like I've seen you before.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Well, I sure don't know you.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
...Did you come to the Lunar Capital a while ago?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
I s-suppose.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Nitori","
Oh my, it's been so long since I met a human,
my sworn friends. Why did it have to turn out this way...
Oh well, if you really want to get into the mountain,
you'll have to show me how serious you are!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
You're, you're strong, I can't believe my weapons couldn't beat you ...
I didn't think humans were that strong.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Well, time to move on.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
Hey human. Kappa and humans have been sworn friends
since ancient times, so let me tell you something.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Sworn friends?
Are you sure you haven't mistaken an old enemy for a friend?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
It's true that there's been a restless god on top of the mountain lately.
Are you going to go beat her?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Well, what an unexpected place to get such great information.
I'd forgotten why I'd come all the way up here.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Nitori","
I can't believe it. Humans are so flaky.
I knew I should have asked the tengu about this instead.
Well, I'll tell the kappa around here about you,
So just go on ahead.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I can see a waterfall up ahead ...
And now for the main event!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Hmmm, I'll think it over,
but first I'd have to meet that god.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Sanae","
What!?
You mean, your goal is...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
To go punish a god that's doing bad things.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I've made it to the lake.
She should be somewhere around here.
What is it with all these ominous pillars on this mountain?
Well, come on out!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Who calls for My presence?
Oh?
Why, it must be the shrine maiden from down the mountain.
What is your business here?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Quite a frank god, aren't you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
These days it's easier to win faith with
a friendly attitude than with a solemn air and august presence.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Whatever, it'd be a problem you tried to
take over my shrine. Please don't do that, ok?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
I don't wish to take over your shrine!
I wish to save it.
I wish to bring more people to it.
I wish to deliver it from the wicked clutches of youkai.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
It's really none of your business.
Besides, even if we did set you up in my shrine,
I'm not sure that would net any faith.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Kanako","
It's not as if your faith can go below zero.
What Gensokyo lacks...
is hearts that believe in gods.
A shrine maiden like you should understand that, yes?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I think it would be nice if more
people would come to visit the shrine too.
But I can do something about it on my own...
I don't need to borrow your powers...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Kanako","
A shrine does not exist for its maiden.
A shrine is a home for a god.
Now, I think...
It is time for you to seriously rethink the purpose of a shrine!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Hardly ever have I had a serious match,
and you were stronger than I expected.
With that power, maybe you could even beat that pain of a god.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Now, take me to where she is already!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I can't really see through all the falling leaves...
Can I really make it all the way to the mountain like this?
Huh?
I smell something tasty...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Even though you're a shrine maiden, you want to eat a god?
How ridiculous! What insolence!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Who said I was going to eat you?
But is that delicious smell coming from you?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Mai","
Well, you passed the test, sooo...
We hereby invite you
to meet the ultimate god hidden behind your back!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
*pant, pant*...
I hardly expected there to be such a big place behind a door in someone's back...
The world really is full of wonders.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
Ah, I see you've arrived.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
You're the human who my two servants mentioned, I see.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
There you are!
You're the ringleader of the incident!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Incident?
If you mean the out-of-order seasons,
the berserk fairies are to blame for that.
A natural phenomenon, essentially.
It's nobody's responsibility.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
I'm not here to listen to any of your excuses!
Here I go!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Well, wait a moment.
We'll be parting ways after this anyway,
so why not talk for a while longer?
My name is Okina Matara.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
I am the god of the back door,
a god of impairments,
a god of noh performance,
a god of outcasts, a god of stars...
And I am one of the sages
who created our Gensokyo.
Sooner or later, I need to find some successors
to take over from those two servants of mine.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Successors?
What are you planning to do with me?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
However... that lousy pair certainly brought
me a strong human, that's for sure.
The Hakurei shrine maiden, of all people!
Well, it should go without saying that you don't meet the qualifications.
You can feel free to return to the front-facing world.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
What?
Quit playing around already!
You might not have any business with me,
but I sure have some with you!
Resolving this incident is my job!
I'm gonna defeat you and return Gensokyo to normal!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
How very foolish.
Let me declare this!
Victory against me is impossible in your current state.
As long as you have that door of the seasons on your back,
any battle between us will be nothing more than a farce.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Hmph! Stop quibbling already, let's just go!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
I'm not quite sure why,
but it seems like this blizzard is giving me strength!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Hey, you! You're in the way!
I've finally got ahold of the culprit,
so move it already!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Why, who's this?
It's the Hakurei shrine maiden!
You're pretty reckless, coming into the
Forest of Magic all by yourself.
There's no way I'm throwing away a chance
to fight the shrine maiden, of all people!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Oh my, my, my.
I lost!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Quit getting in my way.
At this rate, I'll lose sight of that weirdo who was just here.
The visibility here is already awful to begin with.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Someone was just here...?
What are you talking about?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
It sure is hot...
Just glancing around here, there doesn't seem

to be anything abnormal happening...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
What's up?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Larva","
If the shrine maiden's out and about,

then did an incident happen, by any chance?
I've got more power than I know what to do with,

so how about I help you out?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Good grief. Looks like the only ones benefiting from

this season incident are you dumb fairies.
I haven't sunk so low as to need help

from some fairy, you know.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Okina","
Fine, very well.
If you so insist, then show me!
Show me the noh of darkness that you dance
in this maddening frenzy of danmaku!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Ringo","
This is interesting!
Looks like I can play with you without holding back!
Stand in awe of the moon's style of fighting(Lunatic),
where not even taking a single hit(making a single mistake) is allowed!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
I'm just getting started here!
You could have held back a little.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Ahh, there are some pretty strong
people on Earth, huh?
You've got all sorts of food, too.
I wish I had been born on Earth...

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Um...
What in the world is going on now?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
We've come to purify
Gensokyo, but...
...us moon rabbits(underlings) don't really care about that.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Huh.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Excuse me?
You're the ones who were attacking Gensokyo, right?
I'd say you're the destroyers.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
The Lunar Capital is what's
really under attack.
Via a method that renders us people of the moon
unable to act, to boot.
I was considering migrating to Gensokyo
to prevent us from being wiped out.
The people of the moon aren't aware
of any of this, though.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
The Lunar Capital gets invaded,
so you invade Gensokyo in turn?
Real opportunistic attitude you've got there.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
However, that fate has begun
to be overturned right now.
Our migration to Gensokyo
will surely go unrealized.
In exchange, you, an earthling,
shall save the Lunar Capital!
I shall now put it into words.
You can no longer escape from fate.
Fate has begun to turn over.
Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Kyahahahaha!
Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies!
Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic tiiiime!
Welcome to a world of madness!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Looks like I wound up
somewhere really desolate.
That aside, I'm supposed to save the Lunar Capital?
The story's gotten kind of weird somehow.
The fairies around here are hustling
way more than usual, too.
I guess you can find the squirts just about anywhere.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Not quiiite.
Usually, the moon's near side (Surface Moon)  is a lifeless world.
It can't even produce fairies.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Oh, you again.
Although you look sort of fairy-like, too.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Yes! I'm a fairy from hell,
Clownpiece!
You're the first visitor we've had
since honorable friend gave us this land!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Gave you the land?
Where exactly is this?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
The surface moon is the outer side of the Lunar Capital.
It's way more comfortable than hell!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Well, yeah. Compared to hell,
just about anywhere would be paradise.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Oh, right.
Honorable friend told me something.
""If anyone comes from the Lunar
Capital, show them no mercy!""

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Didn't you hear me before?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
An Earthling who makes silent children cry!
The Hakurei shrine maiden! That's twice, now!

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Mm. Got it.
So, what's a shrine maiden doing here?

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Reimu","
Uh, well.
I came here looking for whoever's
invading Gensokyo, but...
At some point I wound up having to save the Lunar Capital.

","Reimu","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Minoriko","
Gods always put a great deal of care into their odor.
Oh, by the way, I'm the harvest god.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Mmmm, so that's why you smell like half-baked sweet potatoes.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Minoriko","
Freshly-harvested sweet potatoes make up my perfume.
Do you think I'm going to let a shrine maiden eat me!?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Ayayayaya...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
I came to check on that intruder report,
but I never thought it'd be you...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I don't have any business with any of you tengu.
Get out of the way.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
We received an intruder alert,
and for some reason they called me onto the job.
I'm just a simple newspaper reporter...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
What are you trying to say?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
It's because I'm the one that knows the
most about you.
Maybe it would be best if I could talk you out of it.
That was the boss' plan.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
I told you before, I don't have any business with the tengu.
I just want to see the god that lives on the mountain.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
The god of the mountain?
Aha~ So, you mean that god?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Do you know something about her?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Lately, there's a god that's been giving even us some trouble.
She keeps acting like this mountain is hers...
And she's even come down to the foot of the mountain lately
to try and gather faith...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
...So she's gathering faith.
That's got to be her.
I want to meet with her. Where is she?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
If she really got out of hand, we tengu were going to go
beat her, so you don't need to do anything.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Oh, come on, I've come all this way.
Take me to wherever this god is!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
But there's no way I can let you through.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
The tengu patrollers won't stand for it
if I let you through that easily.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Geez.
You tengu are such a pain.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
Belonging to a group means that sometimes,
you don't get to have your way.
Now, I'll go easy on you,
So come at me with all your might!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Thanks for going easy on me, but...
You could just let me through, you know.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
What are you going to do there?
Don't you know it's dangerous?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
If you get in my way, I'll treat you like an enemy.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
I'm a friend of humans.
I take their misfortune and pass them on to the gods.
If you like,
I can take on all of your tragedies.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Youkai are my enemies.
You're a youkai.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
Oh, really!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
I was just trying to be nice and chase you away...

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Chasing me away really isn't that nice.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Hina","
From here on is the world where the gods live.
You'll regret this.
It's no place for humans to go.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Oh, good.
It looks like I finally made it to Youkai Mountain.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Ack, a human!?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
H-huh?
Where are you going?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
Awww, my optical camouflage suit broke!

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
What's that?

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"???","
You're a human, but you picked me out pretty well from the camo.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Aya","
That god showed up here not too long ago with
a shrine and a lake.
There's a new shrine up the way a bit.
She should be there.

","Reimu","Scenario","Mountain_of_Faith"
"Reimu","
Yeah, uh, hello?! YOU'RE obviously

the one intruding here!
I'm gonna find out who you are,

and I'm gonna be real thorough about it!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
How mean!
All I've been doing is protecting

the shrine for you...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Hm. You don't seem to be lying after all.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
Yes! I've been protecting shrines and temples

from simple enemies all the time until now.
It's, like, volunteer work?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Huh, I see. I hadn't noticed at all.

I'm sorry.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
No, that's all right! Contributing my help in such

a way that I go unnoticed is fun, really.
But this time, for some reason, no matter how long I tried

to stand around, I couldn't help but go back outside...
Maybe I was entranced by the cherry blossoms?

Even I'm not quite sure.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
...That aside, though, a komainu?

You don't seem related to the season incident either.
There's only one season left to check out now,

but I don't feel like there'll be much there either...
Is my intuition starting to fail me?

I've never had such a total lack of leads during an incident.
Or maybe... I overlooked something big

hidden among my previous opponents...?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Aunn","
It seems you're headed out again then!
You can leave the shrine in my capable hands!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
A fairy, a yamanba, a komainu...
Hrrmm... Wait. Nah, no way.

Well, no, on the other hand...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Could you be one of the
chosen ones?
I was trying to be real flashy about all this,
but you still took way longer than I thought to show up.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Just who are you?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"???","
I'm brimming with power!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
My, what's going on?
I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I've just got to try this out
on the human in front of me!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Ahahahaha!
This gal here is your next opponent.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Wait-- HEY!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
The girl who was floating behind you a minute ago.
Didn't you notice her?

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Well, I'm always alone...
Aaall alone in the forest...
*sniff*...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Oh, well. Uh.
Sorry about that.
Really, though, what's going on here?
Who was that just now?
...In all four seasons' locations...
There's been people who normally stay hidden,
suddenly showing up with unbelivable power.
No way this is just some coincidence!
There's someone pulling the strings very close by!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Ahh, my back feels hot for some reason~.
Even though we're in the middle of a blizzard...
How strange...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
Your back...?
AH!
Uh, there's some kind of
door stuck to your back?!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Narumi","
Huh?
Wow, talk about scary.

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
I've got them in my sights now!
Time to hop on through this thing!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Reimu","
There you are!

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
What the?!
How'd that human get in here...?
Ohhh. Guess I forgot to close that
jizo's back-door on my way out...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Satono","
Oh, Mai.
You're such a scatterbrain.
You went and pulled a human in
before the order even arrived...

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Mai","
Eh, well! The tide should turn in our favor now, anyway.
I did a real spectacular job out there, after all.
If you ask me, Master's gonna say
""well done! This is perfect.""

","Reimu","Scenario","Hidden_Star_in_Four_Seasons"
"Marisa","
Yeah, I guess it doesn't.
So, if I defeat you, you'll open the gate?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lunasa","
Lyrica, is this a friend of yours?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Maybe if this place didn't reek of death.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Are you smelling with your eyes?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Yes, exactly.
Damn, this is the first time I see such an irritating spring.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
You are rude.
The spring that you feel here is none other than the spring of your Gensokyo.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
That's rude.
What kind of person can smell with their eyes!?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
You're lagging behind in the conversation.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Sound travels slowly in the Netherworld.
A place with such a slow speed of sound does not deserve a pleasant spring.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
What the hell am I doing here?
It's easy to become lost in the winter mountains of snow.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
And do you know why it is so easy to lose your way?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
What a pity.
I'll turn up the heat and we can continue our chat.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
You can do that later...

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
It'll take just a moment?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa_and_Yuyuko","
I'll take my boring spring, corpse-girl!
I'll take your pitiful spring, black witch!

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
No, not at all.
For a human to have come all the way to Hakugyokurou,
death is the only possible explanation.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Well, I'm alive.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Yet you passed through that barrier with your own will.
It's no wonder the spirits here are making a great clamor at your foolishness.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Well, it's warm here, anyway.  Nice and warm.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
That is because we have gathered all the spring essence in Gensokyo.
The ordinary cherry blossoms are beyond even the most idealized full bloom.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Dead bodies having a nice flower-viewing. How elegant.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Yet even this immaculate bloom is insufficient for the Saigyou Ayakashi...

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Saigyou Ayakashi?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Our pride and joy, our youkai cherry blossom.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
I'd like to have a look at that, myself.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
In any case, with just a little more spring,
our Saigyou Ayakashi will reach full bloom.
The tiny trace of spring that you brought here
will bring us yet another step closer to full bloom.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
After all that trouble collecting my spring.
I won't hand it to you so easily.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
We are one step short of full bloom!

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Or better yet, what would you say if I were to snatch away all of your spring
to make those cherry blossoms bloom for myself?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
I will not hand over my spring.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Me neither.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
The things that cannot be cut by my Roukanken, forged by youkai...

I am the representative of Bishamonten,

Yeah, by the time I realized what happened.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

As its name suggests, it's a storehouse that flies through the sky.


It was filled with the lord brother's miraculous power.


That power was strong enough that with just a touch,
it raise one's physical ability and can cause them to fly through the sky.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

The Storehouse had been sealed away deep underground with us
for several hundred years.

by a geyser welling up.


Then, the fragments of the Flying storehouse were scattered
as the geyser spewed out.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

A geyser?  That's right, there's been frequent
geyser eruptions since last winter, I wonder why.

had already been scattered by fairies.


We need Myouren's magic in order to break Hijiri's seal.


However, the only thing with any of it left
are the fragments of the silo.

I don't really get it, but these UFOs are important, right?
They're valuable, right?


They were making those fairies go berserk, too.
I wanna take them home and study them.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

You can't take them now.
We need them in order to break the seal.


We can't let you take the treasure
and use them for some fiendish purpose.


I didn't want to do this, but I have no choice.


The light of this jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten
will cleanse the evil from your heart!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Well, I can see how you could have collected the treasure.
At this rate ... ...

Yes!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Uh, no,
thanks.
Humans these days are so rough!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
What the hell?


Now I've learned the fact that I won't be able to catch
a ship flying in the sky by flying just above the ground.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
There was a treasure response from over here ... ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
What?  It's that human from before.
Boring ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
A treasure reaction?
Is there treasure around here?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Nope, that's not it.
Looks like the response was coming from you.


But humans have a rarity factor of 0,
so I think I'll just ignore you.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I thought my body was relatively rare, though.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Well, I'd better go find the next treasure,
or I'll never hear the end of it from her.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Are you looking for treasure?
Does it have anything to do with that treasure ship?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Treasure ship?
That thing floating up in the sky?


Maybe it looks like a treasure ship,
but it's not, now.


Well, I don't have any business with humans, but ...


Too bad for you,
but it looks like my little mice are really hungry.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Just what was that mouse, anyway?


Don't tell me the treasure ship got infested with mice?


Well, I guess I'll have to go find out for myself.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Please wait just a minute~

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I can't wait.
That ship is calling out to me.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Oh, my, so you're just going to hurry right on?
Well, I guess I'll leave you now, then.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
... ... Wait.


You're just going to leave?  That's pretty suspicious.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Well, I won't leave, then.
I've got lots of time.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What's with you?
Are you a patrol from that ship?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Ship?
That's got nothing to do with me.


I'm just a cheerful youkai who lives to surprise people.


So, be surprised--

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Yeah, right.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
*sob*

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
If you're not related to that ship, please don't get in my way.
I'm really busy right now.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Hmm, will you be surprised if I do this?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Booooo!
Did that surprise you?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Not at all.  All the other youkai in town are like you.
Not a single one is interesting at all.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hm, so you're in the business too ...


I'd really like that reward now, though.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
In the business?
Can you also use magic?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Yep, that's right.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Then I'll have to think on it;
it won't do if I give you something you could do yourself ...


Does this mean we've reached an age
where magic is widely used?


In my time as a human, because I could use strange powers ...


People hated me, and in the end
they sealed away me down here.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What?
You were sealed away because you used magic?


In today's world ... ...
I think it's okay to use magic, but ...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Oh, thank goodness.
Then I truly will be free.

I'll have to return to our world
and work hard.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hang on a sec, work hard at what?
What are you after?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
I want to appeal for human and youkai equality,
and bring peace to the world.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
... equality?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
I'll save the oppressed youkai.
That is my chosen calling as a magician.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Now, wait.
I can't let you do that.


It's humans that are oppressed in today's world.
Youkai are running rampant.


A youkai like you
should just be quiet and give me my reward.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
I see; I've already given up my humanity.


I suppose it's pointless for a non-human like me to appeal for equality.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
That's right.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple.


What a narrow-minded boor you are!
Now, namusan --!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
That's some pretty huge hide-and-seek.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Whatever you say, you dirty liar.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I won't let a single one of your danmaku
touch the humans or history of this village!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa!
I'm quite sure you haven't noticed yet,
but she isn't human.
She's a half-beast.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
A half-beast that can't transform without the full moon
is just some human, really.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
You know you're a human too, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
If only it'd been a full moon tonight, I could've...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Did the moon return to normal?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
No, she wasn't the one.
It must've been that other one...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
I may have lost, but do you really think
you can oppose my master?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
There's no way we'll lose.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
She looked pretty dinky to me.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
I'll admit I wasn't strong enough this time...
But my master has the greatest brain of anyone on the entire moon.
There's no way she'd ever lose
to fools like the two of you.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Wha? Using your brain for danmaku?
Are you dumb or something? Danmaku's all about power.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Comments like that are why people think you're dumb.
Danmaku is all about brains. It's just common sense.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Did the moon return to normal?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
No, she wasn't the one.
Hey, check that out...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I get you. That door's open a little bit.
The strange air in there is the strongest I've ever felt.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
So this is why all the ghosts here were noisy...

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
...maybe because a living human has come here.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
If I'm a dead human, won't they make noise?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Well, if I don't go any further,
I can't exactly hand over my spring to you guys.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Everywhere I go,
everything is in full bloom.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Not yet.
It shall happen soon.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
!

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
With just a little more spring...

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Even the Saigyou Ayakashi will be in perfect bloom.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
I got it right here.
That last drop of spring.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Ah. Would you like to take Youmu's place, then?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Nah, I wouldn't want to live out the rest of my life in a place like this.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
How about just a subsitute?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Are you listening to me?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
I am.
You're saying that when you die, you want to die beneath a cherry tree?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
You don't understand what I am saying, do you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Anyway, all I want is to loosen the seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Well, do it, then.
Is something good going to happen?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Who knows?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Well then, I ain't giving it up for free.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
What about our flower viewing?
It shall be lively and exciting.

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Marisa","
Just a little while, I killed some lively and exciting guys on my way up here...

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Are the cherry blossoms of the Netherworld not tempting enough for human eyes?

","Marisa","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Miko","
You could never manage to govern over these desires either way.
My ability, to hear and understand ten desires
at once, is necessary for that!
Now, attempt to defeat me!
And lay bare your own desire!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
Have at it!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Please let me handle this!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
You damn fool!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Your pathetic power isn't worth talking about!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
Good grief!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
You haven't won yet!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
Once again?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Haven't we done enough?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
Enough playing around!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
The Netherworld at night is eerie as ever...

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Oh, do we have visitors?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Hold on a moment,
 I'll prepare some tea.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Hold up! No need to waste your time on me.
I just wanna hear if you know anything
about these strange spirits.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Spirits?
Do you mean me?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
If you want to check up on me,
you'll have to beat me first!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Alright, now tell me like you promised.
What are all these spirits running around?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
These are divine spirit children.
Bundles of human desire.
Ghostly as they may be, they're not related to the spirits here.


","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Desires? Thought it might be something like that.
Sorry for the bother.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
So, where will you go now?
Perhaps to the cemetery behind the temple?


","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Oh-hoh?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Man, this temple's

totally aimed at youkai.

A youkai was even on sweeping duty earlier...

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Good morning.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Good morning!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Oh, mornin'.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
You're too quiet!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Keiki","
Even though you seemed like you had a plan...
To flee right before your foe...!
I'm disappointed, you know.
I guess beasts will be beasts after all.
That's it. I'll destroy this human's body of flesh,
and build it anew from soil and water!
Humans from the surface are rare!
I'll make you the best idol in the Animal Realm!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
You've done well to survive this long, human!
Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now!
Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
There's no need to apologize.
You're just the human who came

to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy.
Nothing more...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
T-That's true.

I did come here to defeat them.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm,

located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure

located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Center of the Animal Realm, got it!

Welp, let's just give it a go!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Oh sneak attacker, chosen by the otters!

Remember the iron-clad law of the Kiketsu Family!
There is no route swifter or more effective than the rear!

Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Lotta beast spirits here, huh?
Looks like they're coming from across the river,

no doubt about it.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Hey, you there!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
All the stones we were stacking fell over

because you were thrashing around!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
This is the first emergency situation we've had

since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Well, this has gotten pretty weird.
But whatever, I might as well

believe you, otter spirit.
Alright, let's head to the Primate Garden!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
To think that living humans
were such strong creatures!
Everything feels like a dream!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
So this is what's inside the burial mound, huh...
This place is just weird on top of weird.
Otter spirit, where's our enemy?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
(...)
(This was always the most beautiful
garden in the entire Animal Realm...)
(I'd heard the rumors, sure,
but this really is atrocious.)

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact

that nobody was left to fight against us...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
There you are!
The god of destruction who defies the law of beasts!
Keiki Haniyasushin!
The time has come for your ambitions to be crushed!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Oh, that's good to hear. Animals ought
to be nice and lively, after all!
I can smell that particular fishy scent
of the Kiketsu family coming off of you.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
......!?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
But you look like a human, though...

Just what kind of cowardly scheme did you come up with?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Hey, wait. I don't just look

like a human, I am one.
I'm just using an animal spirit

for a bit to get here.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
(...She's not afraid of a live human?!)
(Lady Kichoooou!
This isn't what you said would happen!)

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kogasa","
*sniff*
My reason to live as a youkai ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I might be surprised if you could protect me from the rain
with that umbrella you've got there.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Oh, so you're saying to go back to square one!
Maybe that's not a bad idea ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well, I caught up to the ship I was chasing,
so, see you.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Humans, fairies, and all, a real crowd is
dropping in ... are they after the treasury?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
A treasury?
I like the sound of that.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Well, no point in arguing!
I'll show no mercy to any sort of scoundrel!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Oh!  To think that there are still humans that
wouldn't run away after seeing this fist ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
So I guess this is a story where I'll get the treasure
if I finish you off ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
... ... She got away.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Just what are you after?
Treasure?  Or my sister's power?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Your sister, you say?


... ...
But more importantly, the treasure.  Yeah.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
I knew it, you're just a common thief!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
I'm Ichirin, and I'm taking my sister's place guarding the treasure.


I won't let any thieves in alive!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Ah ha ha!  A thief?
Just who do you think I am!?
I'm no simple thief!
I'm a normal magician!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
And?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well, I, uh ...
So, please, don't worry about me, okay?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
... ... What?
You mean, that girl in black has ...?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh?  What's wrong?
Why are you talking to yourself?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Unzan tells me
you're gathering the fragments of the floating treasure.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Fragments of the secret treasure ...?
Well, I picked up some weird thing that was driving the fairies crazy ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
I see asking the mice to search wasn't any use ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Thank you for finding them!
Now I can finally revive my sister!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
How splendid.
I can't believe there are humans like that in this world, too ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I wouldn't lose to a youkai like you!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
If you're collecting the floating treasure, then
you're trying to revive my sister too, right?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What's this secret treasure you're talking about?
You mean these flying things the fairies were dropping?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Very well, very well.
You seem to be an ally, so ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
... ... What?
Are these flying things actually worth something ...?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well, I think I get it.


There's nothing on this ship.


So, I guess I'll just have to take this flying treasure
or whatever home and study it.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Is someone there?

A human ... ...?
Or have you also given up your humanity?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

... ... A youkai?
What *is* this ship, anyway?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Oh, it looks like you've got something nice.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hm?
So, you're interested in this?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Yes, as long as we have that,
we can turn this ship towards its destination.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Destination?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reisen","
Ahh, that's--

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Where they keep the gunpowder?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Where they keep the gunpowder.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Nowhere else for us to go, then.
Since it's the gunpowder of the one who caused this incident.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Right you are.
Once we head over there, that gunpowder will solve everything.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Aww, my master's going to get mad at me...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa!
Shoot her!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Yeesh, you don't hafta tell me twice.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
You just keep poppin' out and runnin' off again.
Impatient, aren't you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Impatient?
My, aren't you two stupid.
Have you still not realized
how far I've led you astray?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa, look around!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I'm lookin'.
We wound up outside at some point.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Yes, the outside.
You were led through that eternal corridor, and came here.
So,
how's the air outside?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Which is to say, there IS air outside.
Outside the Earth.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa! This is strange.
That moon, and those stars...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
You've just been saying ""Marisa! Marisa!"" for a while now.
Can't you do anything by yourself?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Hahaha.
And thus, the humans who depart for the moon are led to this false moon.
The passage between the Earth and the moon
has been severed, by my hand.
With this, you Earthlings will never reach the moon.
And the people of the moon will never find the princess.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Princess?
Oh, so you're moon people?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
What makes you think that?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
When people go crazy, it's usually because of the moon.
That's all.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
The princess, myself and Reisen certainly came from the moon.
But, we can't go back there now.
Not since a long time ago.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
It doesn't really matter to us
whether you go back or not.
Haven't you moon people considered those
who like looking at the moon?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Well, about that...
If the Earth's people only looked at it,
there would be no problem, but...
There were also foolish Earthlings who deliberately came
all the way to the moon,
and in the end, stuck a flag on it
as if it were their own.
That's why Earthlings have always been, are now,
and will forever be inferior.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Hmph.
We never did such a thing.
There are people on Earth who'll suffer without the full moon's presence, too.
Didn't you think they'd retaliate
if you stole the full moon from that Earth?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Oh, that's fine.
My spell is already complete, you see.
Once morning comes, we'll give you back your full moon.
Of course, it's always really been ours, anyway.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Oh, a'ight.
So, that means all that's left is the retaliation you get
for having hidden it up until now.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Yeah.
Now, how badly should we beat her up?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
My, my, I don't want to be hurt.
Unfortunately for you, though I happen to know a bit
about medicine, so some minor injuries won't be a problem.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
You're the one that's too loud!
It's way too early.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
Heheheh. You mean to deny my purpose of existence?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
Despite how I may seem, I'm a yamabiko.
If I turn a deaf ear after getting my specialty yell rejected,
 I'd be losing my worth as a youkai!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Getting squabbled by a youkai...
Today ain't my lucky day.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
""Today ain't my lucky day.""

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
An echo spirit, huh?
So all you do is parrot things back?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
That is all I do, so
don't tease me about it.
Well, where are you off to?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
She mentioned the cemetery behind the temple...
Feels a little awkward messing around near graves.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Hm, you're that?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kogasa","
Ah, you came at a good time!
I saw this girl I've never
seen before keeping watch back there.
But no matter how much I shoot her,
I always lose by time out...
So hey, do something about her?
Please.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Oho, even a youkai's at a loss?
Very interesting.
I'll wipe you two out together!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Where's this girl
Kogasa mentioned?
Hm, I feel a warm breeze...

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Dooon't come any closeeer!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
This is no place for
the likes of you to enter!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Is that so?
So who is it a good place for?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Ummm... who is it good for?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
What are you protecting?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Um... what am I guarding...

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
This won't result in a conversation.
Is your brain rotten?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Rotten as I may be, I'm a jiang shi.
Right! I remembered!
We were revived to protect the mausoleum!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Jiang shi, eh?
Ah, so you really are rotten.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
I can't let you enter!
Though I can't quite remember why...
But if you want to become
one of us, feel free!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Curse yooooou!
I'm done fooooor?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Ah, geez...
Fighting a zombie in a cemetery?
What kind of third-rate movie is this?


","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
This isn't a movie?
I'm a zombie?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
So do you know anything
about these divine spirits?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Divine spirits?
What're those? Are they nutritious?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
I was a fool to think I could make conversation with a corpse...
Well, you rest in peace, now.
Amen.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
When it's 10p.m., wake me up.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
I'm not gonna wake you up!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Ooh, there's a meaningful-looking door...
No choice but to go in!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Welcome.
So you've been guided here as well?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Yeah, I was.
By some weird ghosts and a corpse.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
It seems you took care of my
cute underling just now...

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
So then you're its boss?
Dumping corpses isn't very admirable behavior, y'know.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Dumping?
No, no, I haven't dumped her at all?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
You called?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Once you've become a corpse,
you can't die any further than that.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Whuuuh, who are you?
What time is it?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
...Still morning.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
An early riser!
Good girl, good girl.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Now, now, are you up to another round,
With this girl who has absorbed all the divine spirits that gathered in the tomb?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Keiki","
Heh heh heh.
You there, human.
Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
*sob sob*
The children were looking forward

to this contest so much...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Talk about a bad aftertaste...

I-I'll come back when things calm down, okay?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
This river's as creepy as always...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human

in the Sanzu River(a place like this).

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Are you lost?

This isn't a place for the living.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Sorry...

I kinda lost track of where I was goin'.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Do you want to return to Gensokyo...?
Heh heh heh.

What perfect timing.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Hm?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Feeding time for my ancient fish

just rolled around.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Heh heh heh... Excuse me, but could

you watch my baby for a moment?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Mrgh. You're strong.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
What's up with that stone baby?
It was so heavy, I thought I might

end up fallin' in the river.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
You can hold it, even though it's so heavy...?!
Dang, you must be a lot

stronger than you look.
Alright.

I'll stop trying to drown you.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Oh, you were trying to drown me. Yikes.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Just as I'd expect from someone

trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
And who're you?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast
spirit you are looking for is not me.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
The beast spirits you see as your enemy,
are  not here in Hell.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huh?
B-But the beast spirits are

coming up from Hell......

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
This is because they had to pass through Hell to reach

the Human Realm from the Animal Realm.
How about I guide you to your enemy?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Now that you say that

I do feel like you aren't my enemy......

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
I am no foe of yours.
If you can beat me,
I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
W-wonderful!

With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the
enemy you must defeat.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Who exactly are you?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
I am the leader of the Kiketsu family.

There's no way you don't know what that means.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
M-My sincerest apologies,
Lady Kicchou!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
(Huh? What?

Why am I apologizing?)

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huh?

T-the stacked stones...?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
We were supposed to hold our stone-stacking contest today...
I won't forgive you!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Welp, this ain't good...

I don't really wanna fight...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
Get out of this riverbank(here)! Now!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
Gugugu... So strong...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Minamitsu","
Oh, where are my manners?
I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.


This ship is bound for Hokkai,
the world where Hijiri is imprisoned.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Did you say Hokkai?
The heck's that?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
A corner of the infinite area of Makai.
That's where Hijiri was sealed away.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Makai ... ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Are you afraid now?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
No, I want to go to Makai.
As a magician.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Magician?
Hm, are you not human?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Well ...
Well, anyway, mind taking me along?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Hehe, unfortunately we can't bring
powerless passengers with us.


Now, leave the treasure here and return back to earth!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
You're strong ... ...
Oh well, I suppose we'll let you board.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Uh, I'm already on board.
So, Makai ... ... You said we're going to Hokkai,
so if I ride along, I'll get there, right?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Yes, since you brought the treasure,
we've already under way.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
The miasma usually makes it impossible to go there,
but lots of interesting things have fallen into Makai.


I guess this time I'll just bear it and
go collect lots of rare items!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
By the way, this ship is a one-way liner.


We're not planning on leaving Makai ... ...
Is that okay?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Wait, hang on!
Stop the boat!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Hmm?
So you came to Makai, too?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hmm?  It's that mouse from before.
I knew I could smell treasure in Makai.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
I've already found my treasure.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What?  No fair, the barrier was holding me back
so I couldn't get far into Makai.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
No, I wasn't looking for something from Makai.
It's this jeweled pagoda, shining with the light of Buddha.


Perfect timing.
I'll test this treasure out on you.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hmmm.
Hey, hey.  It's great that I've gotten through Makai,
but I can't get any farther down, can I?


What's that?
I don't understand this seal at all.


I'll never be able to get
any treasure or anything else at this rate.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
You're the human who gathered the flying treasure, yes?


Now, let us begin.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hmm?  Do you know
how I can get in here?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Yes, I do.
That's why you brought that, right?


Those fragments of the Flying Storehouse.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Mm?
Oh, uh, yeah.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
I am the representative of Bishamonten,
a devotee of Hijiri's creed.


Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought,
 as well as the fragments of the Flying Storehouse you possess,


We can break the seal here.
We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oho, so, if you break this seal,
then something will come out, right?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Hm?  You gathered all the treasure
without even knowing that?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Oh, no, uh,
I guess I just kinda forgot.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Hm, from the looks of it,
I'd say you never knew.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Tee hee.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
That's pretty convenient.
Can we ask you to fix up our nutrition as well?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
And, by the way, medicine can be used to attack, too!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
What are you doing!?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Eirin, I grant you one more chance with my power.
If you lose this time...
You there, you stray cats!
With the medicine made by my power, and Eirin's true strength,

you'll never forget this as long as you live!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Geez.
I told her not to let them come this way.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Wha? I didn't know that.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Feels like we're headed in the right direction.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Hey, it's the full moon.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Yes, it's quite simply the full moon.
A true magic power that you've all gazed at
for hundreds, no, thousands of years.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa, that full moon is dangerous.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
The moon's dangerous?
Are ya half-asleep, sayin' that?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Perhaps you can't see them yourself, but...
There are a ridiculous number of full-moon-beams falling on us now.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Don't call it weird names!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Now, the original power of the moon has been revived.
This moon with no impurity throws its pale light
upon an Earth with no impurity...
This light is an ancient memory, forgotten even
by the superior people of the moon.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
In short, they're full-moon-beams.
I can't see them, but I can feel them slappin' down on me.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
At this rate, ordinary humans would go insane
in less than 5 minutes.
Are you okay, Marisa?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Ah, I'm used to being insane.
But what's up with all this, anyhow?
Why's there a full moon now?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Thanks to Eirin's spell, the pure moon and the pure Earth
have been isolated.
By staying here, it seems I can hide myself
from both the Earth and the moon.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
There's no way we can return that moon yet.
Even as we speak, our relations with the Moon's people
are worsening still.
At this rate, there is no way for our princess to escape
other than by making the Earth into a huge sealed chamber.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
What? Who're you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa, watch out.
That person's power isn't like anything I've felt before...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
It looks like the two of you are using a copy
of an ancient power.
A chaotic power, from the time before humans were around.
Those were the days.
I wonder if special powers should be patentable.
Well, before anything else--
Udonge, I'll leave this to you.
Whatever you do, do not let them take our princess.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Leave it to me.
I won't let a single one of those closed doors be opened.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Whaaat? Chattering away like that,
and then just running away...
It's like she's saying,
""hey, come beat me up later"".

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Ah, the moon sure is beautiful tonight.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
What? Does it seriously look like that to you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Hmph. It's beautiful, isn't it?
What do ya call a moon like this? The matsuyoi? 

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
I envy your carefree manner. 

If I could have enjoyed moon watching, and hadn't been short of hands...
I'd never have taken you with me tonight.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Guess there's no choice.
If you want to kill the general, shoot his horse!
Prepare youself!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
How splendid.
You're not an ordinary human, are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
I'm an ordinary magician.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Come, come, no need to be modest.
For a flesh-and-blood human to be able to fight me is truly amazing.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Okay, then, I'm an amazingly normal magician.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
So, what is your goal here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Ummm, what was it, again?
Ah, that's it! grave looting-- er, archaeological investigation!
It's a pretty academic goal.
I'm also interested in the divine spirits gathering here.
Academically.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Divine spirits, hmm?
They're actually vulgar spirits hoping for her powers
to turn them into real divine spirits.


","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Hm?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
What the...
Where's the door on this thing?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Aah... this fateful day hath finally come.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Thou who hast praised my resurrection: speak now, and name thyself.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Congratulations.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Thou mayest call me Mononobe no Futo.
Mine return doth indicate that one who wouldst deny
the Crown Prince's resurrection hath appeared.
Is it not so?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Is that so?
I really have no idea.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
It is most assuredly so.
I was laid to rest here that I might
defend this tomb, if need arose.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Hmmm.
I don't really get it, but it looks
like there might be some treasure waiting for me in that tomb.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
At last, thou hast revealed thy true nature.
The protection of mine house from such miscreant thieves as thee
is the purpose of mine resurrection!
Inscribe into thy very body this fusion of the secret art of the Mononobe
and the way of the Tao!

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Ugh!
Hast thou conditioned thy body for this encounter?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Yeah, for my health.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
...Alas, mine power doth lack greatly its usual potency,
so soon after resurrection.
In such a state as this,
I was without recourse to prevent my defeat.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
A lame excuse...
Not that I mind, though.
Well, then, with that,
I'll be investigating inside.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
No, stay a moment.
Hmm, these shades that doth
linger about thee are...
Vulgar spirits!?
Mayhap...
The Crown Prince hath been resurrected!
I cannot remain here like this.
Excuse me, if thou wouldst.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Oi, oi,
you're just gonna leave me here?
Well, whatever.
I guess I can come in, then.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
This place is bigger than I thought.
Now, then, is there anything of value around here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
There is.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
This place is filled with
priceless valuables that are irreplaceable.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Whoops, someone showed up.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
Have a look around.
These transient lights, like stars in the sky.
Each and every one of them is a human desire.
Observe a human's desires, and you can understand the entirety of that human.
Past, present, and future, as well.
One might say that this mausoleum is Gensokyo's Akashic Records....

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Understanding everything from desires?
I finally understand, now.
You gathered the divine spirits here, didn't you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
That's right.
Although, technically speaking, not entirely so.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
These desires gathered here themselves,
after instinctively sensing my resurrection.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
How convenient...

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Marisa","
Uh, sorry about that.

I'm kinda in a hurry...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I am Kutaka. I watch over

the border checkpoint of Hell.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Ah, so you're Hell's gatekeeper.
Then would ya happen t' know

what's goin' on in Hell?
Like, are the beast spirits tryin'

to conquer the surface or somethin'?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
There's always some turmoil or

another occuring in Hell.
Even violent power struggles

are an everyday occurence...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
B-but this time it looks like the surface's in trouble.
Is there any way you could let me into Hell?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I'm well aware of your intent to go there.

Therefore, I shall test your strength.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
After all, if you cannot even dodge my attacks,

then visiting Hell would be futile.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Th-That's enough.

I've seen all I need to.
With strength like yours, you may very well

be able to handle yourself in Hell.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
That so? Phew. I was honestly kinda

worried about goin' to Hell...
But I s'pose there wasn't any need to worry.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Oh right, that reminds me.

I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to

trust that beast spirit possessing you.
Your heart, in particular, already seems

to be falling under its control.
Take care not to get caught

in one of Hell's schemes...

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You've done well to follow me.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huff, huff...
Hell's winds sure take a toll on ya.
Anyways, what a suspicious person.

I'm glad I found you.
You're the beast spirit
who's trying to take over the surface!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Whoa,
this place is very different
from Hell back there.
Is that the ""structure in the
center of the Animal Realm""
that the person back there mentioned......?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A human?
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste,

or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
What's the Primate Spirit Garden?
Do you mean that burial mound thing over there?

It's certainly a garden for spirits.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm!

You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in

such a dog-eat-dog place as this?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
I'm not a resident of this place.
I came here from the surface to

exterminate the beast spirits, and......
......
(Ugh, why can't I move!?
...Is the otter spirit doing this?!)

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here

just to destroy the lot of you!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

That aura I feel from you...

Could you be an otter spirit?

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Otter)","
That's right! Now, face the elite

underhanded tactics of the Kiketsu family!

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Ah, I see. You're an agent of Kicchou, from the Kiketsu family.

","Marisa (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

What led you here may be the power
of the treasure that Hijiri left.


However, you may be against her revival.
You may be just a thief ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
No, no, I just
want to go down in there.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Just a thief ... ...


Still, even if you are a thief,
there's no denying that you were chosen by the treasure.


However, if you've chosen to follow the wrong path ...


Then I'll have you bow down
before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
So your path is not a wrong one.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
You're just sorry you lost.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Now, let us prepare to lift the seal.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Y, yeah.
That's right.
But first, there's something I wanna ask you.
What happens when you lift this seal, anyway?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
That's for Hijiri to worry about.
It's none of our concern.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hm, maybe I messed something up here.
If things go south, I'll have no choice
but to take control of the situation.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Bweeeeh.


There's nothing here
in this world.


Well, I guess it's Makai, that's for sure.


There's magic power pouring out of everywhere here.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
O, the world of dharma is filled with light.

Are you the one who liberated this world?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
You ... ...
I've been looking for you.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Who on earth are you?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
I'm Marisa the magician.
I was curious, so I came all the way down here.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
I see, you're a magician ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Who are you?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
My name is Byakuren.


I was a monk a long, long time ago.


Well, perhaps it would be more accurate to say I was a magician?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What?  You're a magician?
You're in the business?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Yes, I suppose you could say that.


Is that why you wanted to save me?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
No, that wasn't what I had in mind, but ...

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
But, that aside, has the world become a place
where it's okay to use magic?


In my time, because I could use strange powers ...


People hated me, and in the end
they sealed away me down here.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What?
You were sealed away because you used magic?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Yes, that's why I recognized youkai as equals
and called on others to do the same.


Will you support me in that?

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
In today's world ... ...
I think it's okay to use magic.


But, youkai and humans are not equal!


Humans are weaker,
so they need more protection!


Saying youkai and humans are equal
doesn't make it true.


Especially coming from a youkai like you.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
I see; I've already given up my humanity.


I suppose it's pointless for a non-human like me to appeal for equality.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
That's right.

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple.


How superficial, greedy, and unjust you are!
Now, namusan --!

","Marisa_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Ya don't look too small.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
Right? You two?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Totally enjoying it. 'Least, I am.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

Well, I'm enjoying myself, too!

At least more than you, Marisa.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
Didn't you just say something completely different?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Of course not.
I'm not enjoying the moon-watching, but the--

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Firefly-watching, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Almost, but not quite. Very perceptive of you, though.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Wriggle","
...If you don't come, I will!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
It's more like firefly-HUNTING.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
You realize firefly-hunting is about 
catching them, not beating them up, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
I wanted to catch it, but you went and
squished it!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Geez, what a pain...
Don't get me wrong?? all I did was dodge it.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

Wait, waaaait!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Where are you going this late at night?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
It's my annual Youkai Extermination Month.
I'll go wherever youkai live.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Wait, what?
Are you picking a fight with me?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Marisa is just a type of person who exterminates youkai repeatedly.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Oh?
Don't you know how awesome I am at that?
After I've fired my magicannon, there are no humans left,
let alone youkai.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
You, human...
Don't you have any idea who I am?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
There's no human that doesn't fear me on night roads.
If I wanted, I could call enough youkai here to eradicate
every human in this land.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
...hmph. What does this night sparrow think she's saying?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Hahaha~
Looks like you still don't get who I am.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Human?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Human.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Human all the way.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Er, well.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
All right?
Starting tonight, you two...
Will never again see in the dark.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Ah, I can see clearly.
I can do just fine in any darkness.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
For goodness' sake!
We've got no time to waste on such small fry!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
But where are we heading, anyway?
There's no way there are any enemies in that direction.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
I feel a strange air from over this way, though.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
There's only humans over that way.
All innocent, much like m'self.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Is it you?
Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Nahhh.
We're just passing by. Don't mind us.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

Hmph, I won't trust the words of a youkai.
I'll make this night never have happened!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
What the heck are you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
By that you mean,
""Whoops, I gotta be somewhere else,"" right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Naturally, I can't retreat any further.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Now, are you gonna surrender the humans to us?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Miko","
To one such as I, who has seen each of your ten desires,
your past and your future are visible.
You will defeat me, and then
search this mausoleum.

","Marisa","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Cards?
You mean these mysterious little Ability Cards?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Ooh, looks like I've got a bite.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Those cards are dangerous items.
They sure ain't cat toys, I can tell you that much.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Hmph! You might say that...
but you want 'em too, don'tcha?
And they're not dangerous or anything.
I mean, everyone's collecting 'em!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

""Everyone's collecting 'em""?
Looks like things have gotten pretty serious.
Looks like I'll start
by investigating your cards!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Ggh...!
There's no point in attacking me!
But you won't be getting any Ability Cards
through violence, that's for sure.
I need somethin' of value in return, right?
That's the basis of the entire free market.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
The free market? Are you saying that everyone's buyin' and sellin' those cards?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Duh, of course!
So, are you gonna buy? Or aren't ya?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
O-okay, fine.
I'll buy 'em. I'll buy 'em! How much are they?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
...Heh heh heh.
Now we're talking.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
According to that cat, the cards
originated from the Youkai Mountain...
But this is my first time visitin' this area.
It's sheer cliffs all around...

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Oh! You're a human after all.
I thought I'd mistaken what you were, back there.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Bingo.
Looks like the cat wasn't lyin'.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
This cliff is a secret hideout for we, the yamawaro.
It's no place for humans to be skulking around.
So get outta here, quick!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Pretty lucky for me to have found
someone with cards on 'em this quick.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Cards, eh...?
I guess you've been sniffing around for them after all.
These are too much for you puny little humans to handle!
Begone from our mountain!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
So, what are you going to do now?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
I'm investigating 'em out of pure curiosity!
That, plus the tiniest hint of wanting to hoard 'em.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Well, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.
I may have designed the cards,
but they're out of my hands by now.
If you do seriously want to investigate their
whereabouts, collect them, and so on...
I suggest you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
I see...
Got it!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
...Are you alright with this?
Letting her leave, and reach that god?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
This is... the entrance to the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
In that cave is a mine full of dreams. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.
It's dangerous inside, so
I'm watchin' over the place.

"Marisa","
Oho... intriguing.
I'd better check this place out too.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Man, this cave is ridiculously deep.
Seein' this magic shining with rainbow light...

You there, human!
Stop at once!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

when your head took off.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Do you want to...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
See me do that again?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Were you scared?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Well, uh...
Not really.
But ya grossed me out.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Urrgh...
Humans these days are so fearless.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Well, I'm just special.
Don't cause a racket in the village, okay?
You'll make the kids cry.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Besides, the most I did was
try and attack someone of my own accord.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Hmm...
Doesn't seem like yer lying.
I see...
Everyone's on edge.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
I thought these clouds appeared suddenly,
but this's really somethin' else.
There's gotta be a bad guy in here.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Wait a sec.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Why don't you fight with me?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Ahhhh,
ya sound like ya wanna be exterminated.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Do you think you can defeat me?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Ya look pretty confident.
Didja set a trap or somethin'?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Hehehe.
It's because the moon is full tonight...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
So what?
Uh...
A full moon in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost?
I got a bad feelin' about this.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
A mermaid in the lake?...
Do you mean Wakasagihime?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Yeah.
Do ya know each other?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Somewhat,
thanks to the grassroots youkai network.
Though I also tried to eat her once
by mistake.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Hmm, I see.
So you are plottin' something, right?
A bunch of normally quiet youkai,
gatherin' in secret...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
That girl, attacking people?
Are you sure you're not mistaken?
That girl is so timid that
she wouldn't even kill a fly!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Yes. Now is the time when
the bamboo forest is a moon-blessed territory.
I feel sorry for you,
having to fight me here...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
A werewolf, huh?
I've been meetin' a lot of half-humans today.
First was that mermaid in the lake...
Not sure about rokurokubi, though...
Are they human from the neck down?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Ahahaha.
I suppose the strong and weak really are incompatible...
However, I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the ""Miracle Mallet""!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
The Miracle... Mallet!?
The one that can grant any wish!?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
You're right to be scared.
I can see a strong person trying to flee from me.
Now, my treasured mallet!
Impart your power of dreams to all the pitiful weaklings!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Alice","
Wait, wait, Marisa!
Who said we were gonna eat the humans?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Hmph.
To think that youkai would come as far as this village.
Is it because of that abnormal moon, after all?
They've only come here rarely before.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Nobody's saying we're gonna eat them.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Anyway.
I'm in a real hurry!
I don't know who you are, but we don't
have time to waste for any humans.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
You're mean.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
If you were just quietly passing by,
I wouldn't try to stop you.
But you two are being just a little too noisy.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
See, she called you noisy, Marisa.
That's because you're going all-out with your magic
even though it's the dead of night.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
What are you sayin'?
Magic's something you've gotta cut loose with at night, y'know?
The only things worth using secretly in the day
are cyanotypes and stuff like that.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
I felt an unpleasant feeling approaching,
so I sealed the village...
Seems I was right to do that.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I TOLD you.
Nobody's saying we're gonna attack the humans.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
(...Didn't you just say ""surrender the humans to us""?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Really, the only human I'm concerned with is you!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
She certainly is.
But whether or not we do that depends on...
...whether she's the culprit behind this incident or not.
If we forget about that, it'll be morning.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
You two are ignoring me too much.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
You see?
This hypnotic corridor is one of my traps.
Since you two can't fly straight,
you'll be completely wiped away by my power!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
That should be Marisa's line.
You'll be completely wiped away by her magicannon,
you hogweed.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Hey, don't take my cool lines.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
I wonder if you'll still be able to say that
after gazing into the eyes of this lunar rabbit?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
But...
While this spell of Eirin's is perfect,
I don't really like it.
There's nobody else here.
Nobody visits, either.
I'm bored to death.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
An Earth with no impurity has nobody on it.
That's a very Lunarian-esque mentality.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Isn't this good timing?
You can play with this impure pair here as much as
ya want, and then we'll take you away.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Well, since I wasn't born here,
it'll be quite the challenge for you to get me out.
...I remember having another exchange like this,
long, long ago.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Eh, I don't really care about the full moon,
but this girl here won't stop throwin' a fit
over it being gone.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
I'm not just throwing some fit.
If you keep messing around too much, divine punishment
will fall upon you.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Divine punishment? That doesn't sound good.
My stay on Earth is already a divine punishment as well, though.
I know. Whenever someone came to take me away,
I gave them an impossible request.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
An impossible request?
You mean if we fulfill it, we can take you
out of here?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Finally time for the bad guy to show up, eh?
You really kept me waiting!
I thought I was gonna follow this tunnel all the way to Hell.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Are you even listening?
I'll warn you one more time.
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease
to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
I won't be able to breathe, huh?
Threats like that won't work on me!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Honestly, now.
I'm not even telling you this as a threat...
I'd rather not see this place be sullied
with an ignorant human's corpse.
Will you leave on your own, or be carried out?
Choose at once!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Hm, not bad.
I certainly didn't expect you
to be this strong.
Young Marisa Kirisame.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Y'know who I am...?
Gh, I can't... breathe...
Wh' th'hell are you doin'...?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
I told you, didn't I?
Even at this depth, the oxygen levels are
already about half of that on the surface.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
I-I give up...
There's nothin' I can do if I can't breathe.
But tell me this one thing.
What th' heck are ya diggin' for down here?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects
that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before
the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
...Izanagi Objects!
You're gettin' magic items from the gods' era, then.
Dang, diggin' up stuff like that.
I-I'm jealous.
Damn... I can't take another breath...

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
By the way, you've come to investigate
the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside
and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making
profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
I really do recommend taking some deep breaths up there.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
A human's here!
See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something
like this up for long...!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
*Inhaaaale*...
Hwaaaaah...
Dang, yeah!
Takin' deep breaths on a mountain is the best!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Why, what's this?
Out on a nighttime hike?
Or perhaps you're stranded?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Good grief, you're strong...
But it's too bad for you!
Cards can't be taken through violence.
Those are the rules.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Ya can't take cards through violence...
That cat said the same thing.
Hearin' that makes me feel too
guilty to steal the things.
Welp, alright. I'll buy one.
First I'll buy, then I'll investigate.
How much you want?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Ooh! If you're a customer,
then that's quite a different story!
Now, go right ahead!
They're all great deals!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
The hell's all this racket...?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Get lost!
You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You followed me all this way, huh?
Guess you're not just
some ordinary rioter...

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Who're you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
My name's Sannyo.
Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.
And who are you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
My name's Marisa Kirisame.
Folks like to call me Genius Magician, though.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Heheh.
So, what brings Miss Genius
up to this mountaintop?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
This is an emergency.

I don't have time for a pleasure cruise!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Just as I'd expect from someone

trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
And who're you?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
I am Kutaka. I watch over

the border checkpoint of Hell.
I've been testing you,

to see if you're capable of withstanding Hell.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Heh heh heh.
You there, human.
Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
I am the sculptor god(Idola Deus) who protects the
human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other.
Don't you agree?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huh?

Are you human?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
Don't be fooled, magician.
She's a wicked god who destroyed
the divine blessing of Nature!
She's an enemy of beasts and humans both!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Wh-what?

I don't really get it.
Who's spitting lies here?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
To trust in me or the beast spirit?

I wonder why you hesitate?
I am a god that saved

the humans who were being persecuted!
The beast spirit possessing you right now

is the enemy of mankind!
Well?

Won't you join my side...?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
(T-this is bad!
There's no time to lend her an ear, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts!
Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
We must retreat for now!

RUN!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Even though you seemed like you had a plan...
To flee right before your foe...!
I'm disappointed, you know.
I guess beasts will be beasts after all.
That's it. I'll destroy this human's body of flesh,
and build it anew from soil and water!
Humans from the surface are rare!
I'll make you the best idol in the Animal Realm!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
You've done well to survive this long, human!
Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now!
Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Oh? I'm sure you've seen enough, then.

Lemme through.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Hmm... not quite.

At your level...
I doubt you'd even make it

to the first ward of Hell.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Then stop it with the kiddy stuff,

and hit me with some Hell-level attacks!
I'll dodge 'em all!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Of course. That was the plan.

I'll show you Hell before you even set foot inside!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
W-Well done.
Now I understand why the Yama

said to give you permission.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
I mean, I DID beat up the Yama(her) that one time.
So, next up is finally Hell, huh...?
I don't care how strong they are down there!

I'll kick all their butts!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Oh right, that reminds me.

I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to

trust that beast spirit possessing you.
And with that, please enjoy your time in Hell.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
A tsukumogami, huh?
Perfect.
If I follow someone like you,
I oughta figger out why my Mini-Hakkero started actin' up.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Now, now. That's my prey, you know.
Swiping her away is not very admirable behavior.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Hmmph!
It's your fault for running away.
I saw you fighting her before, anyway.
Your plain, linear music
won't work on her, big sis.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Ah, um...
I don't mind fighting both of you at once...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Well...
It's always been my dream to
fight against a human and win, you know.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Well, whatever.
I'll just look for another opponent.
I'll leave the rest to you.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Huh,
so it's just you, then.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Don't underestimate me just
because I'm a tool.
The meek have gained power
in this world of social upheaval.
Even mere tools can rule the world!
I'll make you the foundation we'll stand on!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Wow?
I can't stand up to that.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
You said something
weird before, didn'tcha?
A ""world of social upheaval,"" or something?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
I mean...
Even tools like myself can possess power.
Isn't that awesome?
This is no time to be sitting around.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
So does that mean you're taking
revenge on humans, or what?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Not just humans.
We plan to rule the entire world someday.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Hah!
Mere tools, ruling a world?
Wait, hold on...
I see...
Is this why the Mini-Hakkero
started moving on its own?
Could ya tell me more
about this?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Even the youkai who've been docile up until now 
have gotten more powerful, too.
That's the kind of world it's turning into.
All of our power comes from there,
that inverted castle floating in the sky...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
What?
What do you want?
This isn't a place
for humans like you.
Leave at once!

"Seija","
What are you talking about?

"Marisa","
You've been controllin' the tsukumogami.
You're plottin' something, right?
I heard it from
a koto tsukumogami.

From a tsukumogami?
Haha.
I see. It must be part of the ""payment"".

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Huh?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
The tsukumogami are nothing but a bonus.
What I wish for is one thing only:
Social upheaval!
The strong shall lose their power
and the weak will rule the world!
It doesn't have much to do with you,
since you humans will end up under our heels.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Social upheaval?
Can't have that now, can we?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Why? For humans, it would be a world
of more ease than the one now.

Hey, you!

"Wakasagihime","
Have you come to exterminate me?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Hm?
Oh, yeah, I guess.
Anyway, a mermaid, huh?
I didn't know there was one in the lake.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

You always ignore me.
Isn't it about time us youkai
had our day in the sun?

What the!?
I see. The ones who are stopping the night...
It's you two, isn't it.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
This half-finished eternal night that you have made...
With my spell to manipulate eternity, I'll tear it all away.
The dawn shall be upon us soon.
How's that?
With this, your spell of eternal night shall be broken, and the dawn shall come!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Oh, yeah.
We're trying to restore that full moon.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

Yeah.
We said that to begin with, right?

"Keine","
Ahh?
What the? I never heard that.

It seems to me like you know who's responsible for this.

The promise being one we made just now.

Just as I thought that it was strange

So it was you, Marisa.

"Marisa","
Oi, you've got it wrong.
The only bad one is this person here.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

What!?
You're guilty of the same thing, aren't you, Marisa?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

Doing something like this...
What on earth are you two plotting?

That's, um, y'see.
Reimu, how do I put this...?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"

Why the stuttering?
Just yell at her like you always do.
""You! Get outta my way!""
Like that.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Moron!
It'll get ugly if she gets mad.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Making me mad to begin with is what's ugly, right?
I'll definitely have to teach you
a bit of a lesson tonight.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Hmph.
Will you still think nothing's wrong when you look behind you?
The distorted moon is already that obvious,
isn't it!?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Ahh!
This moon is your doing too, huh?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Okay, fine. I give up.
You're right.
The endless night, that broken, warped moon,
hiding the human village,
and putting hats on the stone statues; 
all of it was Alice's fault.
Now, get outta my way!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, all right.
In this bamboo forest bathed in moonlight,
you two will become one of the shining bamboo trees.
How beautiful.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Allow me to return those words,
albeit a bit differently.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
C'mon!
This endless night will end right here!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Oh?
It's not like her to retreat.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Chase her down, Marisa.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Now, I'll show you two
my true boundary.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
What's the point of squaring off with us again?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
There's two of you, so I get two tries!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
A'ight, let's get moving.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Our destination is now in sight.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, there's not much I can do.
Don't take your evil plotting too far.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Did you say something?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Man. I never knew there was such a big mansion
in the bamboo forest.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Eh?
Oh, me neither.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I'm huntin' down card merchants.
Looks like you've got some cards too, don'tcha?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
So it's cards you want, after all.
I thought as much.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
If you want some, go buy 'em from a merchant in the foothills!
Get lost right now.
You're 80 years too early to even think of buyin' from me!
And if you won't leave,
I'll chase you off with brute force.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Grh. You're way too strong...

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
It's not that I want the cards
so much as I wanna know their secrets.
What are these cards?
Who's making 'em?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
...You don't need
to know about that.
Uh, actually, I don't know either.
It's not somethin' I need to do business, after all.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
R-really?
Well, I guess the investigation continues.
By the way, what's that big,
gaping thing behind you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Who're you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
I am the Great Tengu, Iizunamaru.
I have no interest in
who you might be, human,
but this isn't a place that humans
ought to set foot in so easily.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
A Great Tengu...
Man, I must've hiked pretty deep by now.
Well, I've got somethin' I wanna investigate.
You got time to spare?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
What might that be?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
You know 'bout those Ability Card things?
They're making the rounds down in the foothills.
You happen t' know anything about them?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of
her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a
washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned,
and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
I'm sure that girl just now will do a good job for us.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
....Hahaha.
I see.
When you betray someone, you don't
do it with your own hands.
A wonderful idea, in my opinion.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
What a creepy moon.
There might be some kinda
power at work here, too.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
...And you are?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Chimata Tenkyuu.
I'm the market's main presenter.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
The market's presenter...
So you're the card merchants' manager?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Well, I suppose that's not exactly wrong...
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special
occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're
all able to buy and sell goods.
Put another way, you're essentially
alive right now because of me.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
I see...

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Chimata.
I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
What?
Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah!
It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
By which you mean?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I always knew that she was taking
advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize
that I was taking advantage of her right back!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Oho.
How very interesting.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Hey, mind if I butt in?
You're the fox that was with that tengu down there, yeah?
Weren't you her minion or somethin'?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You've done well to follow me.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huff, huff...
Hell's winds sure take a toll on ya.
But I finally caught up to you!
You're the beast spirit
who's trying to take over the surface!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast
spirit you are looking for is not me.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
The beast spirits you see as your enemy,
are  not here in Hell.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Huh?
B-But the beast spirits are
coming up from Hell......

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
This is because they had to pass through Hell to reach
the Human Realm from the Animal Realm.
How about I
guide you to your enemy?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
T-Tell me more
about that.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Then it's decided.
If you can beat me,
I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
W-wonderful!

With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the
enemy you must defeat.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Who exactly are you?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
I am the leader of the Kiketsu family.
Do you really need any further explanation?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Leader of the Kiketsu family......?!
What the... I've only heard of them just now,
but I already know her somehow...

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
You're the human who came
to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy.
Nothing more...

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
I'm not really satisfied with that answer, but......
I guess it's fine as long as I can fight the enemy.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm,

located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure

located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
The enemy's in the center of the Animal Realm, right!?
I'm kinda getting excited now!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Truly reassuring as I'd expect!
Oh warrior of Keiga, chosen by the wolves!
Now, go!
Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
Whoa,
this place is very different
from Hell back there.
Is that the ""structure in the
center of the Animal Realm""
that the person back there mentioned......?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A human?
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste,

or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
What's the Primate Spirit Garden?
Do you mean that burial mound thing over there?

It's certainly a garden for spirits.

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm!

You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in

such a dog-eat-dog place as this?

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
I'm not a resident of this place.
I came here from the surface to

exterminate the beast spirits, and......
......
(Ugh, why can't I move!?
...Is the wolf spirit doing this?!)

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa (Wolf)","
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here

just to destroy the lot of you!

","Marisa (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Marisa","
No, no.
Because I'm one of the strong ones.
For me, ""social upheaval"" means a revolt.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Ah...
You don't understand either.
If the thought of how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed so much
has never crossed your mind,
then...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down,
I'll give you a taste your first failure!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Ugh.
How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
I told ya I was one of the strong.
I'm surprised you could even think of flippin' the world
on its head when you're so weak.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Not yet.
I haven't given up!
As long as we have that treasure,
we can become as strong as we want.
...As long as we can turn a blind eye to the price.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Ah, wait!
You can become as strong...
as ya want?
Now, don't that seem interestin'.
I'll just go ahead and follow her.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Hey, it's totally cleared up outside.
That's rejuvenatin'.
In a place like this, how could anyone think
about overthrowin' society?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Who's theeere?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Oh, it's that famous magician I've heard so much about.
You came at just the right time.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Marisa","
Are you plottin' to overturn society?
I won't stand for that!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
The first obstacle is you, who has fought a hundred battles...
But I won't give up!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
I won't rest until you all know
the kind of humiliation that
the inchling race has endured!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Minamitsu","
Yes, it was built to carry Hijiri about,
so a holy palanquin.


Of course, its only passengers nowadays
are you, me, and a few youkai.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh, yeah, it's pretty empty.


So, where's this ship headed?
Why's it flying?

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
This ship is bound for Hokkai.
We'll save Hijiri and create a new world.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Huh.
I don't get it at all.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Minamitsu","
Actually, there's something I haven't told you.


We need the treasures you have
in order to reach our destination.


You've let us gain considerable time
on our journey there.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
Hey, woah, this is turning out to be pretty amazing.


It looks like that ship has
come out to try to find me!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
No, no.
It's not looking for you.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
It just brought me here, is all.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
What's this?
A mouse?  Hey, I just saw you, too.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
I'm just looking for a little something.
I came down because I picked up on a treasure response.


Anyway, it looks like it was just reacting to you.
What a letdown.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
A mouse from a ship ...
Don't tell me you've eaten through all the food supply already!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
That's not really a ship.
Well, maybe it looks like one.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
It sure does.
I have good eyes, you know.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Alright now, human.
I've got some work to do, so ...

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Marisa","
You're not getting away!
If I let you get away, something bad will happen!

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
I don't really want to fight you, but ...
Oh, well.

","Marisa_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Alice","
Bye bye, now.
It's time for the good girl and loser to go home.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Reimu, it's an eternal 'skip one turn' for you.
See ya later.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
You're too late.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
I've sealed all the doors.
You can't take the princess away now, can you?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Whoa.
That corridor was so long and dark, Alice.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
How about we deal with her, to begin with?
That one in front of us.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Hey, what?
You two are... people of the earth, aren't you?
What are you up to at this time of night?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
It'd take an entire day of wiping to clean a hall that long,
no matter how good a janitor you were.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
I think it'd still be much faster and easier
than cleaning your house, Marisa.
--okay, now, come on. Let's deal with her, hm?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Looks like some weirdos have already snuck in.
We're busy right now.
If you have no business other than burglary, leave now.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
The only ones who'd be busy at this time of night
are the ones who aren't living honestly.
Right, you colleagues?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Since Marisa will never get to the point, I will.
You or your cohorts are responsible
for this warped-moon incident, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Indeed.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
So, will you return the moon quietly now,
or return it after we give you some trouble?
Take your pick!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Alice","
Hey, don't just take all my cool lines.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Parsee","
You're now on floor B666.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
Welcome to the end of the underground skyscraper.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
See? I told you there were floors.
It'd be hard to tell how far you'd gone if there weren't.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(I'm sure you could tell based on
how much time you'd spent.)
(But, there's an enemy here, right?)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yeah, yeah, I'll beat her up now.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
A human going to the Former Capital who talks to herself a lot...
Are you crazy?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, didn't we just
bump into you before?
That means you're the boss of the dungeon, right?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(Yes, she's the boss.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Parsee","
I wouldn't recommend that you treat going underground like a game.
You might be trying to get experience points,
but you'll just be wasting time in the end.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Yeah, I guess I've been wasting time.
I didn't get much at all for that.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(H-, hurry up.
We're almost to our destination.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh? Finally...
Wait, where were we going?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Alice","
(The Former Capital where the sealed-away youkai live.)

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hm.
It's nice that the dungeon was so short.

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hey, you're pretty good.
No idea who you are, but they say
a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so
Keep following until you can't take anymore!

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Oh?
I don't really want to follow you, but...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Marisa","
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you...

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"???","
Hm? What's that?
Give up already?

","Marisa_and_Alice","Scenario","Subterranean_Animism"
"Tsukasa","
Yes, of course.
Master Iizunamaru is the highest and only master I serve.
As Miss Chimata is my master's precious friend,
I thought it best that we share information to ensure that none are at a disadvantage.
I believe it would be best for you, too,
to avoid angering Miss Chimata.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Wow, you sound shady as hell. Makes sense for a fox.
Whatever, though. I finally found the one
who's putting the cards on the market.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
*Giggle*.
So, shall we begin?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Begin? Begin what?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
What do you mean, ""what""...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've
spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Sell 'em?
Nah, that ain't it.
I'm here to stop you all from sellin' em.
Everyone's getting weirded out, having
cards of 'em made without them knowing!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I see...
So, you were a robber seeking to destroy the marketplace?
I certainly can't let that slide.
The fact that robbers like you exist
is the reason why peace can never arrive.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Whoops, looks like you made her mad.
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
You foul barbarian...
How long are you going to believe that you can
use violence to hold dominion over objects?
Possession of an object can only be
controlled by the god of the markets.
As long as they possess something,
none can escape from the hands of God!
The market has been opened!
Let us return all things to nothing (God) !

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
...You.
That card you're holding...
It's mine...?!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Oh, yeah. I got a dud foisted on me.
It's the most utterly useless Ability Card around!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
""Useless?"" Excuse you!
It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
What an utterly interesting robber!
It's a shame that you're going to die here!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) !
This marks the end!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
The Ability Cards?
I don't just ""know"" about them.
I created them, as a matter of fact!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Huh? What?!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
There you are!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
See, things turned out just like I said they would.
A human would be sure to come snooping up here eventually!
I suppose we have no choice by now.
I shall deal with this human myself.
So in the meantime, Master Iizunamaru, you can...

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Ah-hah-hah!
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You're too confident in your own strength,
despite being a weakling.
If you got injured, I'd be
the one troubled by it.
I'll deal with her.
You get back!

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Heh heh.
Splendid.
I'm fond of brave, powerful people.
I'll hear you out.

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
You said that you made the
Ability Cards a minute ago, right?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Yes, that's right.
I figured I could make a good profit using the dragon
gems dug up from the Rainbow Dragon Cave, you know?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Marisa","
Gotcha. I think I'm puttin' it together.
I've been noticing those rainbow lights
here an' there for a little while now...
Those are all rainbows bein' projected
by the dragon gems, right?

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Indeed.
You're quite the knowledgeable...

","Marisa","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Hey, Sis!
Yeah, you over there!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
I've got some nice cards!
Wanna buy any?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I'm fine, thank you...
Wait, cards?!
Do you mean these mysterious Ability Cards?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Looks like you've got some too, Sis.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
That makes things nice an' easy.
I've got some rare cards lined up here! Better act fast.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
...*Chuckle*.
I'll be taking all your cards, if you don't mind.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Huh?!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
There's no point in letting blockheads
like you have something so valuable.
If you don't want to get hurt,
fork them over right now!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Ggh...!
There's no point in attacking me!
But you won't be getting any Ability Cards
through violence, that's for sure.
I need somethin' of value in return, right?
That's the basis of the entire free market.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
...Huh?
Come again?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Chimata.
I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
What?
Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah!
It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
By which you mean?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I always knew that she was taking
advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize
that I was taking advantage of her right back!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Oho.
How very interesting.
By the way, miss human.
I would suggest you pay careful attention to your remarks.
Miss Chimata is a god of the marketplace, and of commerce.
You have nothing whatsoever
to gain from angering her.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
*Giggle*.
So, shall we begin?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Begin what, exactly?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
What do you mean, ""what""...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've
spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Sell them?
No, that's not it.
I want to stop everyone from selling them.
They're as unsettling as something could possibly be.
Recall all the cards this instant,
and ban any further sale of them!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I see...
So, you were a robber seeking to destroy the marketplace?
I certainly can't let that slide.
The fact that robbers like you exist
is the reason why peace can never arrive.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Whoops. And even when I told
you to watch what you say.
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
How unfortunate...
I can open a marketplace, sure,
but intervening in one is blasphemy
against the market itself.
I can never forgive market-destroyers
such as yourselves.
I absolutely guarantee free trade!
That's what a market god is!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
...You.
That card you're holding...
It's mine...?!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
It's such an utterly useless card that
I was just thinking about throwing it out.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
""Useless?"" Excuse you!
It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
What an utterly interesting robber!
It's a shame that you're going to die here!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) !
This marks the end!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
A human's here!
See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something
like this up for long...!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Commencing immediate attack!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
This is Seiran.
I've made contact with a belligerent earthling.
Now proceeding with purification.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Hm-m?
Those ears... Are you a rabbit?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
We are Eagle Ravi, the investigation corps of the Moon rabbits.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Hindrances are to be eliminated!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
Man,
why aren't any reinforcements coming?
That's why they say that rabbits nowadays
are disobedient garbage?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
By the way, did you see a probe...
um, a mechanical spider-looking thing around here?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Seiran","
I guess you're talking about the Earth probes.
They're returning to the base for now?
Wait, I'm not supposed to tell you this!
It's a secret to everyone!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
I see, I see. So, if you're already at it,
could you please tell me where that base is?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
To think that their base is so close to
our house... what a blind spot.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
I've been waiting for you?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
I heard about you from Seiran.
She said she'd engaged an interesting person...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
I'll have you know that this lake is under our control.
Please don't behave as you please around here, okay?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Do you even know
who we are?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
We are Eagle Ravi, the investigation corps of the Moon rabbits.
We will not receive any orders
from impure earthlings.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
Oh, not bad at all.
You're pretty strong.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Moon rabbits...
Are you friends of the people at Eientei?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
We are military rabbits on duty.
Unfortunately, they are our enemies.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Mmm...
So, that means...
that you're my
enemies too?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
You're not an enemy.
But not even an ally, either.
The earthlings have done a surprisingly good job
helping in the process of purification.
...well, apparently.
Although it's hard to understand for us underling rabbits.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Hard to understand, you say...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Miko","
Enough playing around!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
I wonder if it's really advisable for the Netherworld
to allow living humans in so readily...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Oh, do we have visitors?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Hold on a moment,
 I'll prepare some tea.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Oh, no, don't mind me..
Anyways, I have business with you.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
You know, you could at least start off with
""sorry to bother you at this late hour"" or something.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
These divine spirits have suddenly
started gushing out everywhere.
So would you know anything
about the matter?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Hm...
Divine spirits, you say...
You want to know about divine spirits, do you?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
If you please.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Then it's a duel!
Try and defeat me for it!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
So, you wanted to know about the divine spirits?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
(Did we really need to fight for that...?)

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
A human scream to begin a morning at the temple!
How wonderful!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

What a shout...!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Oh, how this humble yamabiko
still lacks training!

Er...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

What?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Could it be that you're a youkai?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Huh?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kogasa","
Maybe I should go back to being a normal umbrella...

I don't know if anyone would want an old umbrella
that looks like an eggplant...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

That's right, that's how I became an unwanted youkai.
Oh, such terrible old memories......

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Oh my, it looks like I said something I shouldn't have.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Humans, fairies... a mob is gathering.
Are you after the treasury?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Huh?
Treasury?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
No use arguing about it!
I won't show any mercy to burglars!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
My word, to think that there were humans who won't
run away at the sight of this fist......

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
But I'm not looking for a treasury,
I'm just looking for youkai to hunt.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Wait, why are you running away?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
If you're hunting youkai, do it back on the ground.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
But youkai hunting is something you do to youkai!
You're a youkai, right?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Well, yes.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
......
Better prepare yourself!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

I'm living in peace, so can't you leave me alone?
You,
are you really okay with killing youkai?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Uuugh.
I have to do it to complete my great mission.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Humans have gotten so selfish of late.
And yet, even though my own sister was once a human,
she works so hard for youkai......
...... what?
You mean that shrine maiden has...?
Unzan tells me
you're collecting the floating fragments.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Huh?
What are you talking about now?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
I'm sorry, I must have mistaken you for someone else.
You've been working to help revive my sister, yes?
Then we're comrades with the same objective.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Huh?
Er, no, I...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
Thank you for finding all those floating gems!
Now, please hand them over!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

How splendid.
I can't believe there are humans like this in this world, too.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Hmm?
So you came to Makai, too?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Ah! The mouse!
I see you're still alive!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

I can't be done in that easily.

This time you won't be getting up again!
You're pretty weak, after all.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Hey, now, I've still got work to do.
I can't let you do me in
until I hand over this treasure pagoda.
Why don't you let me borrow a little of your power
for this treasure that will light the world with the power of dharma!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Where on Earth am I...?
This is just too creepy...
I've never been in a place with this kind of atmosphere.
I've never seen boundaries like this.
Why did I let them bring me to a place like this?

"???","
I've been waiting for you!
With the flying treasure that you have,
we can break this seal.

Huh? Who're you?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kutaka","
Umm. I'm not exactly sure who

was testing who just now...
Remember this one warning, however:
The spirits of Hell will try to crawl into

your heart wherever there's an opening.
If you're conceited, there's sure to be a spirit

that'll take advantage of that weakness.
As a servant of the Netherworld, I'm sure

you know this already, but just in case...

And your enemy's not here in Hell either.

What a shame.

I'll hear out your little story after I beat you!

With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, allow me to guide

you to the enemy.

Oh?
Are you really not my enemy?
Now that you mention it,
I'm starting to
feel like you're not all that dangerous.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

So you finally realized.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy.

Nothing more...

","Youmu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

Tell me where they are then,

I wanna defeat them quickly.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

The animal spirits are in the Animal Realm,

located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure

located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Animal Realm is a city,

in front of me is my destination.

","Youmu (Eagle)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
Oh, that's good to hear. Animals ought
to be nice and lively, after all!
I can smell that particular fishy scent
of the Kiketsu family coming off of you.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Otter)","
......!?

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
But you look like a human, though...

Just what kind of cowardly scheme did you come up with?

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
W-Well done.
I suppose you'll do fine in Hell.

You won't be killed instantly, at least.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Of course I'll be fine. I'll slice them to

pieces before they even get the chance!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
How very confident.
Remember this one warning, however:
The spirits of Hell will try to crawl into

your heart wherever there's an opening.
If you overestimate your power, there's sure to be

a spirit that'll take advantage of that weakness.
As a servant of the Netherworld, I'm sure

you know this already, but just in case...

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You've done well to follow me.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Huff, huff...
Real karmic winds really feel suffocating huh.

That's Hell for you.
By the way, who are you?
You don't seem to be one of Hell's oni.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
I am the leader of the Kiketsu family, 
Yachie Kicchou.
Right back at you: identify yourself.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Pardon my manners.
I am Youmu Konpaku.
I came from Hakugyokurou in the Netherworld

in order to investigate the animal spirits invading the surface.
The Kiketsu family......
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to have heard of it.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
No, that can't be right.
You must know of us.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Hmm, oh?
Now that you mention it I think I have......

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
We must retreat for now!
RUN!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Keiki","
...You brought a human all the way from the Netherworld
to flee right before your foe!
I'm disappointed, you know.
I guess beasts will be beasts after all.
I'll destroy your flesh,
and build it anew from soil and water!
Half-phantom, half-haniwa,

you'll be an idol that truly stands apart!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
You've done well to survive this long, human!
Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now!
Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
It's just like I heard.
There are countless beast spirits

crossing the Sanzu River...!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Hey, you there!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
All the stones we were stacking fell over

because you were thrashing around!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
The stones? Yeah, I knocked them all down.

Do I get a prize?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
H-How awful! Every pile here was a priceless

masterpiece made by the children!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
I'll avenge them!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Eika","
Gugugu... So strong...

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
In addition, you must also know that the animal spirit you are

looking for is not here in Hell.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Yeah, maybe?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Allow me to tell you where your true enemy is!
Follow me!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
What wonderful skill.
With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, allow me to guide

you to the enemy.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
T-Thank you...
I wonder why... This should be our first meeting,
and yet I feel like that's not the case.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
I'm positive that that's the case.
However, you are just the human who came
to stop the animal spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy.
Nothing more...

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
My... role...
Yes, that is to defeat the enemy!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
The animal spirits are in the Animal Realm,
located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure
located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
The enemy's in the Animal Realm......
It's my first time going there,
but I'm kinda excited!
I'll cut apart everything that stands in my way!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Yachie","
Truly reassuring!
Oh warrior of Keiga, chosen by the wolves!
Go forth!
Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
I've heard that the

Animal Realm is a city,
but this is way more than what I had in mind.
I wonder if that keyhole-shaped thing

in front of me is my destination.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
A human?
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste,

or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Is that the forest surrounded by the lake there?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm!
Who are you?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
I'm a resident of the Netherworld,
I came here to exterminate
the animal spirits, and......
......
(Huh? My body isn't moving!?
Is this the wolf spirit's doing!?)

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here
just to destroy the lot of you!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
That aura I feel from you...
Could you be a wolf spirit?
To think that a wolf would be smart enough
to rely on a living human...

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance
with that loathsome Kiketsu family!
I shall liberate the human spirits(our prey)
from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself!
It is the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
S-So strong! Completely different from a
human spirit of the Animal Realm...! 
What a fearsome strategy...!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
(Yes!
I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks,
swordswoman of the Netherworld!)

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
......
How careless of me. To think that I would be
taken over by the wolf spirit......

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu (Wolf)","
(Sorry about that.
It's me, the wolf spirit.)
(But thanks to you, we can gain entry
to the Primate Spirit Garden.)
(Just a little further...!)
(Just a little further, and we animal spirits
can take back control of the Animal Realm.)
(If we do that, the animal spirits' invasion of
the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(Worry not.
Our objectives are the same.)

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
This is the first emergency situation we've had

since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Got it.
All we have to do is
defeat the boss of the person back there, yeah?
Let's go before my blade rusts.
To the Spirit Garden or whatever!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Mayumi","
To think that living humans
were such strong creatures!
Everything feels like a dream!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
No, uh, I'm real.

I really did just get lost...
I usually have the shinigami

lead the way, but...
I'm in a hurry today,

so I kinda jumped the gun.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Oh. Right. Now I remember.
The Netherworld's gardener has a carefree

attitude... and a totally empty head.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Just as I'd expect from someone

trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Ah, you're Lady Niwatari.
I'm a servant of the Netherworld.
And, see, I kind of

have to go to Hell...

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
So you're already familiar with me.

Let's get straight to the point, then.
I shall hereby test whether you are

capable of surviving Hell.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Oh. Yeah, I... guess we have to fight, huh.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
You'll never be able to survive Hell

with a timid attitude like that.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
If your sights are set on Hell,

then give me everything you've got!

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
W-Well done.
I suppose you'll do fine in Hell.

You won't be killed instantly, at least.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
That's good.

...I guess Hell is up next, though...
Honestly, I'd rather not

have to go there at all.

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kutaka","
Your will is quite weak...

But that may prove dangerous.
The spirits of Hell will try to crawl into

your heart wherever there's an opening.
If you're anxious, there's sure to be a spirit

that'll take advantage of that weakness.
Although it seems that one such spirit

is already present inside you...

","Youmu (Otter)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

Well, this was a pretty good warm-up

before heading for Hell.

goin' on down there, by any chance?

You're worse than an oni...
Go fall into Hell, why don't you!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Ignoring the shinigami's ferry

might've been a mistake on my part...

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"???","
I thought you were a lost phantom...

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
But it looks like you're still alive, huh?

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Youmu","
Are you... that ushi-oni?
I heard that ever since you got banned from attacking humans,
You started a fish farming

business at the Sanzu River.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Yep. The river's a peaceful place.

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
But now that you've come along, it's a different story!

Nobody would blame me for attackin' a human like you!

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Urumi","
Grgh... Now I remember.
You're that carefree

gardener from the Netherworld...

","Youmu (Wolf)","Scenario","Wily_Beast_and_Weakest_Creature"
"Kaguya","
Yes, that is indeed what eternity is about.
The peaceful world.
Actually, I'm able to manipulate eternity.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
?so, does that mean you're the one
who's stopping the night?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Huh?
Lady Yuyuko, isn't that...?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
I could never do something so cruel.
Trust me on that one.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Well, that doesn't matter to me anyway.
I'll be satisfied if we can return the full moon to Gensokyo.
Morning will still come in the meantime.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Well said.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu, this is your final order.
Slash the eternity before your eyes.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Oh, eternity is still eternity, even with pieces missing.
You were saying that just a minute ago, weren't you?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Okay, so I'll slash her
with my Hakurouken here!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Ohh, my head is spinning.
I'm starting to feel sort of gross...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
My, my, your human half got sick
just from being shaken around that much.
How about we go through that door over there
and rest for a little a bit?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Ahh, crap.
There was a door that I didn't have time to seal yet?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
No, I'm okay.
Let's hurry ahead and chase that one from before.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
You sure?
The door that's open is the door to enter.
Our final course is surely waiting for us in there.
Well, it might not be much of a respite,
though.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
We've caught up with you.
You won't be escaping now.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Yes, you won't be escaping.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Are you just wandering around with no goal?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
No, no, Youmu.
We're certainly heading in the right direction.
All you need to do is go where I tell you to.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
What is your purpose?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
To restore this abnormal moon to normal.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
No, no, Youmu.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
!?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
We're having our fill of a wonderful nighttime sightseeing tour.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
You two are really way too suspicious.
Although phantoms are suspicious at the best of times.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Wait, I can't just let you say that.
Phantoms aren't suspicious.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Ummm.
Where'd she go?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Here, here.
You really are half-baked.
You lost sight of me in such a short time.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
What are you doing?
What's that big phantom half of yours there for?



","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Not for chasing people, surely.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Well, this is a false pathway I created.
So it's no wonder that you lost track of me.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
False pathway?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
A false moon in a false sky.
You're really overdoing it with this.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Ah, impressive.
You see that this moon is an illusion.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
That's a very old moon.
One from when the moon was still there in the heavens.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Old?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
A terribly old-fashioned moon, with mold growing on it.
The moon these days has no rabbits on its surface.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Well, no, there are rabbits there even now.
The people and rabbits of the moon have been
living quietly on the far side.
Unseen, protected by a barrier...
Yes, it's much like your Gensokyo.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
A Gensokyo on the moon?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
And so, this illusory moon is a memory of the past moon.
That's why it looks so old-fashioned.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
So, what are you trying to do
by dragging this musty old moon out?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
My task is already coming to an end.
The full moon is the one key that links the moon to the earth.
Just by removing that, no pursuers can reach
the Earth's surface from the moon.
Even now, they're pursuing us to a fake Earth.
To an old, musty Earth, yes.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
In short, you are a criminal.
Those who try to escape from something are those who've committed a crime.
Those who try to hide themselves are those who've admitted their crime.
And criminals who've admitted to a crime
always start making excuses.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
......

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
No, it's not like that.
This may be a bit unreasonable, but I simply didn't want
to go back to the moon because it was comfortable here.
There's no need to worry.
Once it's morning, I'll return your full moon, you see.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko, give me some instructions.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Oh, have you understood what I was saying
by now?
Well then, first, please become my shield.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Leave it to me.
I will be the hardest shield in all the Netherworld.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Seeing as I'll back you up if I feel like it.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Ahahaha.
A shield can only stop something from the outside.
We of the moon have the ability to use
more internal forces.
While you're becoming a hard shield,
the soft parts inside you are slowly rotting...
Yes, you carefree girl over there.
A ""hard shield"" is meaningless.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Don't worry, Youmu.
I'm not alive, so I can't rot.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
I understand.
You're rotting to begin with, right?
But rotten or not, it's the Konpaku
family's duty to protect you.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
I said I can't rot.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
I wonder how long that attitude of yours will last.
This ceaselessly overflowing memory of the moon...
Amongst the Earthlings bathed in it, there are none
who didn't go insane.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Looks like there's no helping it.
Youmu, keep this one thing in mind so you don't go insane.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Ah, you're a phantom and not a human.
I guess you won't rot, then?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Things are most delicious when they're about to rot.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Why are you telling me that now...?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Well said.
However, fermentation is a power granted by the gods.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
You ghosts, unable to rot, have been forsaken even by the gods!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
What are you playing at!?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Eirin, I grant you one more chance with my power.
If you lose this time...
You ghosts there!
With the medicine made by my power, and Eirin's true strength,

you'll never forget this as long as you live!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Geez.
I told her not to let them come this way.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu.
Press on.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Yes. Pressing on now.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko, look.
What an amazing full moon.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
This is the true full moon.
It seems that you two are neither human nor youkai.
I wonder why you've wandered into such a place as this?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu.
Looking at that moon is a fearful thing.
Stop looking at it, right away.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Er, wha, is it really?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
The true moon is fearful, indeed.
That's something that the Earthlings have long since forgotten.
You must be quite the nostalgic human.
Or rather, ex-human?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Every now and then I still think of myself that way.
This girl is still half-human, though.
It'd be quite bad if half of her went insane.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko.
If I look away from the moon, I can't see her either!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Look at her with your mind's eye.
What's that big phantom half of yours there for?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Not for using any inner eyes, surely.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
What fun.
You're neither impure humans, nor youkai.
You truly have nothing, it's quite enjoyable to look at.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Oh no, Lady Yuyuko!
It's completely dark when I close my eyes!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Wouldn't it be okay to look at this full moon
and go insane, just a little bit?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
You can still slash things without looking at them, can't you?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
So, what are you doing here tonight?
What business do you phantoms have?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
If even a little bit of a sphere is missing, it loses its value.
That's because it can't stay round forever.
But, as that flawed sphere is rolled around a bit,
it becomes a full sphere once again.
That's what this is about, isn't it?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Ahh, when I open my eyes all of a sudden, the light is blinding me.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
So you're the culprit?
I've got one less person to slash, then.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Mmm, but don't get all worked up yet.
Udonge, I'll leave this to you.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Leave it to me. There's no slashing going on,
but I won't let a single one of those doors be opened.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
The two of you aren't hearing my song, are you?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Perhaps you're not human?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
It's nighttime, but I hear a sparrow calling. Youmu?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko,
please don't get distracted by this song.
That's the cry of a night sparrow.
It's one of the most accursed sounds in the world.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Accursed? How rude of you.
At the very least, my singing is better than the sound of
approaching phantoms, isn't it?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Yes, indeed. It's no contest at all.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Please don't agree with her...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu, listen! The cries got louder again.
I wonder where they're coming from.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Geeze. Whether you are human or you were human, it doesn't matter to me.
Now, the fun youkai festival begins.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Okay, Youmu. Shall we hurry along?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Huh? Er, yes. I suppose we should, yes.
But we've got to shoot down this bird in front of us, first off.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
I don't like sparrows. They're too bony.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
You shall not pass!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
That night sparrow's appearance is going to attract
lots of youkai and other things, before long.
Let's move on before that happens.
We have to hurry.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Hang on. Got a bone in my throat...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Didn't you just say you didn't like sparrows?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
It's not good to be a picky eater, Youmu.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Is it you?
Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Oh?
It seems we've gotten lost in some strange place.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Yeah, where are we...?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
There's no point in plating innocent.
I can tell you're ominous ghosts.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"??/","
Crap!
These ghosts are really something.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Oh, how cruel.
Treating ghosts like outcasts, really.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
What business do you have in some place like this?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
You attacked us before, right?
We're just going to respond to that.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
There is nothing here.
Just move along already.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
It's easy to say that, but we really
don't know where we're moving to...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Speaking of which, Lady Yuyuko,
why'd you call her a bird? She looks like a rabbit...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
When skinned and eaten, they're the same thing.
Remember that.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Hey, don't tell lies.
...and don't ignore me!
I doubt you'll be able to remain sane
after gazing into my eyes!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Ohh, my head is spinning.
I'm starting to feel sort of gross...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
My, my, your human half got sick
just from being shaken around that much.
Well, don't fret.
Next, we'll eat something that's good for your health.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
I can't believe this.
You're far stronger than I thought...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Next up, herbal dishes. And that's the end of it, too.
Unfortunately, it's not a dragon after all, though.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko.
Do you know something I don't?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Not at all.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
No, no?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Shut up.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
...you two really do seem dangerous.
Looks like I'll have to drive you away from here.
Although I don't quite get what you're doing.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Hey, hey, Youmu.
So far, we've had a bug, a bird, and now a beast.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
What are you trying to say?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Hmph. I'll help myself to all of your history!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Every last bit. Even from before you became phantoms.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
I wonder if a dragon's up next.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko. Please concentrate on what's happening now,
and not what's going to happen next.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
""Beast""? Please, milady, you shouldn't treat humans like beasts.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
No, no, Youmu.
This girl appears human right now,
but she's a half-beast. Kind of like you.
Although, I think humans are beasts too,
so I guess she's a full beast?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Damnit. If the moon hadn't been incomplete,
I'd never have lost to such phantoms...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Oh, yes, yes.
We've got to take back the full moon.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Now, next up is a dragon dish.
I can't wait, Youmu.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Lady Yuyuko, you said you knew where our
destination was, right?
Somehow, I feel kind of concerned.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
A dragon would have lots of scales, though.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Move and I'll shoot!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
I messed up.
I mean, shoot and I'll move.. Right away.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
What?
That's strange, running into you in a place like this.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Well, eh, I'm just hunting some troublesome youkai,
like usual.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Disturbing? Do you know who's doing all this, then?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
I'm telling you, even ordinary people could understand that.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Well, then, I understand.
How could I not, when the ones gathering up this strange air are flying right at me?
Tomorrow's the harvest moon-viewing that we've been waiting for.
I already got bored of staring at tonight's moon.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Oh, you don't seem to understand.
We're the ones who are stopping the night.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Yeah, and?
That's why I came here to kick your butts, ain't it?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Hey, you. The black-clothed one.
Don't you feel anything when you look at that warped moon behind you?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Didn't I just say I got bored of lookin' at it?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
You can't look away from reality.
While we're arguing like this, that moon is sinking lower.
Don't you understand that things will get really bad
if we just leave it be?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Ehh? An endless night will cause far more trouble for sure. 
For instance, the bamboo here will grow eternally if the night lasts too long. 
Might even reach the moon, perhaps.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
The nail that sticks out gets struck down.
Oh? How would you move if you get struck down?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Yeah, I'll move, all right.
I'll keep on moving until dawn breaks.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
What a bother.
I mean, we're headed that way too, but...

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Okay. You shot, I moved.
Now, the real battle starts here.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
You're still up for this?
The game's already decided, isn't it?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Hmph.
There's two of you, so I get two tries!

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
That was such an awful waste of time.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
For phantoms, there's no such thing as wasted time.
Everything is going as planned.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Marisa","
Damnit.
What the heck are you two saying?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
An instant is everything. Everything is but an instant.
The time we spent playing with you was inevitable, too.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Huh?
I see a huge mansion in the middle of the bamboo forest.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu.
Didn't I say it'd be strange to not understand what's happening?
Inside there...
is the dragon dish I've been searching for.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
You're too late.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
I've sealed all the doors.
You can't take the princess away now, can you?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Looks like we've finally found the culprit.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
This is just a space bird.
We're far from done, so don't get worked up.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Huh, some phantoms?
Don't get me all worked up, geeze.
If you've got no business here, leave.
We're in the middle of something right now.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
No way.
This moon incident was caused by you, wasn't it?
If so, I'll slash you.
If not, I'll slash you and move on.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Moon incident?
Ah, you mean the earth-sealing spell?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Right.
This spell of yours is incredibly troublesome.
We'll have you put a stop to it this instant.
Now, Youmu, go slash her.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
Um, er, here I go?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
What rowdy phantoms.
Aren't you going to listen to us for even a little bit?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
My, I thought we had guests, but it's just some phantoms?
Well, there shouldn't be any guests arriving anyway.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Yuyuko","
Youmu, there's another one.
Slash her too.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Youmu","
H-huh? Should I go?

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Oh, look, you shouldn't tease the poor girl like that.
The business with the moon is due to my spell.
But, it was for the sake of the princess and this girl.
Even phantoms ought to have at least
this much kindness in them.

","Youmu_and_Yuyuko","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
We don't need any more intellectuals at the mansion...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Listen. I'll say it one more time.
There never was anything here from the start.
No humans, nor their village.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Something about what you're saying sticks out to me.
Milady.
May I have a bit of time?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
We're in a hurry. An incredible hurry.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
May I have a bit of that devil's history, myself?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Hmph, you're rather full of yourself.
Even though you're a were-hakutaku.
All you do is look back at history.
If you're like that, you can't change your fate.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady.
May I please have a bit of time?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Oh, it can't be helped.
You may use a bit of my time. Just a moment's worth.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Ah, that was refreshing.
Now, let's move on.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
You're feeling refreshed, even though
the village hasn't been put back yet?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Yes, quite so. I feel not one whit of fatigue.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Well, okay. Thanks to her, though, I've completely lost the direction
that the strange air was coming from.
Do you know where to go, Sakuya?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Not one whit.
But, look! We have someone who'd be very useful at a time like this.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Keine","
Wha? You mean the cause of this full-moon incident?
It could only be their doing.
There are few people capable of such a thing.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
My, intellectuals can be useful.
Although we certainly don't need any more.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Our mansion's intellectual is such a bookworm,
she's hardly any use at all...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
We have quite enough useless knowledge already.
We don't need any more.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Stop right there!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
So it was you, after all.
No wonder I thought the flow of time was weird.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
What are you talking about?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Look, you're always doing something weird, right?
That's Sakuya for you.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Oh, how cruel of you.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Well, you're pretty much always doing something weird,
but today you've gone much too far.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Uh-oh.
We see more and more fireflies, and they're so beautiful.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, that interjection doesn't match what you're saying.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
I changed the subject partway through, Milady.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
I only understand the second half.
What were you trying to say?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Wait, waaaait!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
We're in a hurry.
If you can keep up with us, we'll listen.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
So you won't stop even if I ask.
A human and a bat, though? That's an unusual pair.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
I'd like to have that human. But not that bat.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Hmph. Is it the brats' night out?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Naturally! 
Good kids' daytime is when I go beddy-bye.
At night, it's happy hour for man-hunting!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Too bad. We're in a hurry.
So, mind getting shot down right now?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Seija","
Ugh...
That sword's power is an effect of the ""payment"".
I can't believe it would become
something that could slit necks on its own.
But it doesn't matter.
As long as we have that treasure,
we can become as strong as we want.
Good bye.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Ah...
Everything is clear now.
The reason why tools are moving on their own,
and docile youkai are running wild...
is because of that amanojaku's resistance force.
I don't know how she did
it yet, though.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I beat the amanojaku, but...
What could
this strange feeling be?
There must be someone here.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Who's theeere?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
A human?
Do you need something?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Umm,
there was something I wanted to ask you about.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
So there were creatures like her
in the neighborhood.
Hmm... How interesting.
Maybe I shall take a look around.
I wish to test how keen the edge
of this knife is.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
There are even youkai running amok
this close to the Human Village...
It seems peace in Gensokyo
is like the Tower of Babel upon sand.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
You showed up fast.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Have you come to exterminate me?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Well, yes.
I felt like cutting something,
such as a neck...

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
So there are fearless humans, too.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Though that only means
they'll experience terror in return!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Wh-What's with you?
You're actually strong.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Did I even once say that
I was weak?
But... My expectations were off.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Wh-What do you mean?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Because I never needed to cut
off your neck at all.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Who should it be but a wolfman.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
I'm a wolf-woman!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Well, either way...
Your blood will coat my knife.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Eek!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
On second thought,
that could dull its edge.
Let us just settle for striking you with the back.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Striking me with the back...
Isn't that
a double-edged knife?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Hmhmhm.
Well, either way...

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
I'm scared...
Humans are scary!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Hmm...
What am I trying to accomplish
by bullying around youkai like this?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
All these eerie clouds suddenly
turned up.
It certainly doesn't seem like
a natural phenomenon.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
I spy~

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Someone who looks like they could be my opponent.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Wonderful,
an enemy!
My knife was starting
to get rather thirsty.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Wait a sec.
I found her first.
First come first served,
big sis.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
And why's that?
You saw her first,
but your shoddy music won't be enough...
...to defeat this tsukumogami user.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Tsukumogami user?
I see... This bewitched blade
does seem like a tsukumogami.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
What are you saying?
It doesn't just ""seem"" like one,
it IS one, no matter how you look at it.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Hmm. Well, whatever.
I'll leave her to you, Benben.
See you later?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Escaping now, are we!?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seiga","
So, what does a human like you
want with the grand mausoleum?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Something on your mind?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Well, I just figured someone who knows about spirits
might know why they showed up so suddenly

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Do you plan to put them to use for your shrine?
I don't know what's going on, either.
Ghostly as they seem, I know nothing about these divine spirits
that are gathering toward the temple's cemetery.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Huh?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
I just kinda beat down the girl who was
performing her morning duties...
But everyone should still be asleep,
so it shouldn't be a problem!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
It is a problem!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
I got careless thinking that you're just a human.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Ah, so you're doing well.
Great, that's great.
Anyway, the temple starts its mornings
quite early, doesn't it?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
Well, yeah.
That's just part of the liturgy.
I've gotten quite good at being able
to recite sutras from memory.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
That's great.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
Incidentally,
attacking humans is also part of the liturgy.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Huh?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Ummm...
What exactly is going on?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Huh?
Uh, right.

An amazing person is about to be awakened.
These spirits were attracted here by her power
and gathered of their own accord.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Huh, is that right?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Is that not what you wanted to know?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
I don't think I really get it all that very well...
For now, why don't I just
go on ahead through that door?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
I see. Will you convert?
You would make an excellent hermit.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Ummm, I don't want
to be a hermit.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Gensokyo sure is mysterious...
To think that buildings like these
are still lying buried beneath the earth...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Aah... this fateful day hath finally come.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Thou who hast blessed my resurrection: speak now, and name thyself.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Oh, someone's here.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Who art thou that calleth upon me?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Well, I'm a god in Gensokyo,
while acting as a shrine maiden on the side.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
A god, thou sayeth?
Dost thou come before me seeking to deliver me
unto Heaven?
Then mayhap there was value in having once
before tasted death.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
No, I wasn't planning on that.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
...Then what design hast driven thee before me?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
I'm not really sure of that myself.

Somehow or another, I just felt something brewing in the air,
so I came to have a look...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Then thou art a lost child?

Very well,
I will cut through the haze of confusion that surrounds thee.
Wilt thou bear witness as I demonstrate the fusion of
the secret art of the Mononobe and the way of the Tao upon thee?!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Kuh!
What manner of being art thou?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Like I said, I'm a god while...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
It doth matter not.
I now apprehend the purpose of mine resurrection.
The coming of a enemy most wretched hath returned me,
one of the Imperial Guard, unto this waking world anew.
Is that not correct?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
""Enemy most wretched""? How rude.
And anyway, what are these divine spirits?
That's what I'm investigating.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Divine spirits, sayeth thee...?
Mmm, these shades that doth linger about thee are...
Vulgar spirits!?
Mayhap...?
The Crown Prince hath been resurrected!
I cannot remain here like this.
Excuse me, if thou wouldst.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Shou","
I'm the representative of Bishamonten,
a devotee of Hijiri's creed.
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought,
as well as the fragments of the Flying Granary you possess,
We can break the seal here.
We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Hmm... that's right, the UFO was part of a granary.
People will be talking about this for a long time...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Now, come, let us break the seal together.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Hm, let's see, I'm worried about that seal, but......
First I have to vanquish the youkai in front of me, right?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
Youkai?
Do you mean me?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Is there anyone else here?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
You believe youkai hunting is justice, eh?
A lot of people seem to think that way.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
I've come here to straighten out
anyone without the proper reverence for God!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
It's true that I'm a youkai, but I'm also a devotee of Bishamonten.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Wh, what?
But, I'll try to defeat you anyway!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
I see, very well, then!
You have your own sense of justice.
However, if the path you've chosen isn't correct...
Then you'll have to bear witness to the light of dharma which is even brighter here in Makai?
And bow down
before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
I've lost...
I suppose that means what you're doing isn't wrong.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
So you lost!
That's the power of the living god,
Sanae Kochiya!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
So, then, what will you do now?
This is Makai, after all,
and the ship that could take you back home is out of energy.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Huh?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
I think it would be easy for you to get home
with Hijiri's aid, but...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
I, I see. I don't know who she is,
but I suppose I'll have to help you revive this Hijiri.
Oh, Lady Kanako... What should I do now?
......
...... yes. I'll go see this sealed person,
and if she's dangerous, I'll just beat her!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
So, you'll help us?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yes!
Let's do it!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","
By the way, Hijiri used to be human, too,
so she should be willing to help you...
Will you still be able to exterminate a ""youkai"" like that?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Where am I......?
It's like that ill-omened place before never existed.
I wonder what kind of person
would get sealed away in a place like this...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
O, the world of dharma is filled with light.
Are you the one who liberated this world?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Oh, there you are.
Ummm,
I'd like you to take me back to my world.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Hmmm?
That would probably be easy, but......
I'd have expected the breaker of the seal
to ask for something more.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yes, well, before I knew it, here I was...
By the way, who are you?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
My name is Byakuren.
I was a Buddhist monk a long, long time ago.
You seem to be a shrine maiden, am I right?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yes, I'm a shrine maiden that hunts youkai.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
A youkai hunter...?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","Please, go on inside
with the flying treasure you've found.
That will bring about my sister's resurrection.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Mystia","
W-wait! I said ""wait"" already, didn't I?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady.
If you start fights even with enemies of this level,
there'll be no end to them.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
True.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Oh, quit joking around!
Aren't you scared by birds flying in the night?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Birds frying in the night? 
Humans are better, really.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
(How better?)
Milady, you can't turn ""fly"" into ""fry"".

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Mystia","
Whatever.
I'll show you the true terror of darkness!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
""Terror of darkness"", huh...?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Now, Sakuya. Which shall we do:
to fry that bird, or to continue on ahead?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Let's leave the frying for later and proceed onwards.
The night is short.
Speaking of which, why are we headed
in this direction?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Hm? Refueling.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
......



","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Is it you?
Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady.
Let's pass by this place, and quickly.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
I knew that. That's why I said it.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
This is the true full moon.
I wonder when it was that this full moon
vanished from the earth,
along with its power to drive people insane.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
This full moon is...
Sakuya! Watch out!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Kaguya","
Yes, this true full moon will drive mad any human who looks directly at it.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Well, I feel fine, though?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
...I guess you'd be okay, Sakuya.
You're very well-disciplined.
Well, even without Sakuya, I'm still
invincible under this full moon.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, she's the villain.
You can tell with one glance at that villainous face.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
What a cruel thing to say.
I certainly did create this sealed chamber around the Earth.
But, it was for the sake of the princess and this girl.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
If that's the case, we will have to
beat you at all costs.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
Mmm, but no, not yet.
Udonge, I'll leave this to you.
Whatever you do, do not let them take our princess.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Leave it to me.
I won't let a single one of those closed doors be opened.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
I've found that no matter what happens, there's always a path to follow.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
What a pain. As usual, you're not going off
the beaten path, Sakuya?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Just stick to the regular path, and overwhelm the enemy.
That's the trick to avoiding complaints.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Hahaha.
The path to follow is the one behind you.
But, there's no turning back now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
We won't be turning back.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Don't you see that you've already fallen into
this moon rabbit's trap?
Left, right, up and down...
Your sense of direction has already gone insane.
Though you think you're flying straight ahead,
you're actually floating around aimlessly.
Now, gaze into my eyes, and become more insane still!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady, let's proceed along the regular path.
We'll be at the exit soon.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Benben","
Hold it!
You will be facing me.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
In this world of social upheaval
where everything is turned on its head...
Who is the strongest tool?
We'll decide that here and now!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Hm?
That blade...
There's no doubt about it.
That's something I made into a tsukumogami as an experiment?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Huh?
Wait, what?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
You brought it all the way here?
Even humans are good for something.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
No, well, I, er...

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Thanks to the physical traits of the inchlings,
no matter what we do, we're powerless.
There's almost nobody who wants to ally with us.
We're just used, then thrown away.
I'm so glad you came all this way
just to meet me...

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Excuse me, I am sorry to
kill the mood,
but things just kind of led me here.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Nngh.
Okay, I lost.
I surrender?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
No matter how much it cuts,
this blade does not grow dull.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Well, of course.
The whole world is ruled by tools right now.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Ruled by tools?
What are you talking about?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Even youkai who are normally docile
can possess power in this world now, right?
It would follow that tools
would gain the strongest power of all.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
What kind of world is that?
This is the first I have heard of it.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
You want to receive the same blessing too, right?
You should go on ahead, then.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
To where, exactly?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
The inverted castle, of course!
That's where our power is coming from.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
What?
What do you want?
This isn't a place
for humans like you.
Leave at once!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I heard that tools who come here
could be granted power.
I would like to hear
the details...

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
...Ah.
That blade in your hand...
It seems to have gained a sense of self.
Maybe the price for that was too great
if even those kinds of items were affected.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I beg your pardon?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Never mind.
Do you want to become stronger?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Well... I suppose so.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Then become my ally.
We are a force of resistance.
We will re-draw the political borders of Gensokyo!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
A resistance force!?
Well, well...
I think I just overheard something important.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
So?
Will you join our cause?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Unfortunately, I am already
attached to another political power.
To me, a resistance force
means a revolt against us.
I never had the choice of becoming your ally from the start.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
So is this what lake cleaning
is like?

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Hey, you!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
You're the one from that mansion on the bank...

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
A half-fish person!?
I had no idea there was anything
besides fairies living around this dead lake.

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
See?
That's how it is.
You've long forgotten about
the existence of us youkai!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
I see...
That is unfortunate.
If none of you can imagine
how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed...
Then...

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sanae","
Umm...
Do you mind if I come in?
I'm comin' in, I'm comin' in!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
All these divine spirits...
That person just now
called them ""vulgar spirits"", didn't she?
...Hmmmm.
That person just now's name was Mononobe, huh?
It seems like I've heard that somewhere before...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
The Mononobe clan was destroyed.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
I witnessed it for myself.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
!?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Long ago, the Mononobe clan and I opposed one another
for religious reasons.
To the public, it appeared as a confrontation between
Shinto and Buddhism...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
What are you talking about?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
I was said to be the Buddhist faction, 
but that was a ruse that I had prepared.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Umm...
Who are you?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
I am Toyosatomimi no Miko.
People call me Shoutoku Ou.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Shoutoku, Ou?!
The one on the old 10,000-yen bill?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
What era are you talking about?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
...I see. I get it now!
I expected that these divine spirits would be somehow
connected to an immense source of faith, but...
Since a legendary person like you was resurrected,
it's no wonder they just decided to gather on their own.
...Wait, that's not very convenient for my faith.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
Desire overflows from within you.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
I have no reason to fight with you.
""Harmony is to be valued.""

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
But going back empty-handed after
coming all the way out here is kinda...

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
I understand.
If I read your heart's desires, there is no need for words.

Wouldn't you like to fight me,
and achieve some merit should you defeat me?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
Uh, well, but--

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
Pay me no mind.
It will be beneficial towards my resurrection, as well.

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Sanae","
?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
Now, attempt to defeat me.

That will bring harmony to this world!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
Have at it!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Please let me handle this!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
You damn fool!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Your pathetic power isn't worth talking about!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
Good grief!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
You haven't won yet!

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Tojiko","
Once again?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Haven't we done enough?

","Sanae","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Megumu","
Heh heh.
Splendid.
I hereby surrender.
As such, any further conflict is futile.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
You're awfully direct...
Are you really the one
who made the Ability Cards?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Yes, that's right.
I figured I could make a good profit using the dragon
gems dug up from the Rainbow Dragon Cave, you know?
I've made enough money off of them by now,
so I was guessing it'd be about time to pack up shop anyway.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Well, now! I've found the culprit, so that should be a relief for the time being.
Could I ask you to please stop circulating these
cards before any further confusion breaks out?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
That's the thing, I'm afraid. I can't stop
the cards from circulating by myself.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Why is that?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Because everyone who's taking part in the card trade
just started doing so of their own accord.
If you do seriously want to
stop the cards' circulation...
I suggest you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.
She's fully in charge of
circulating the cards.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Is that right? There's
still someone left...
I see. In that case,
please excuse me...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","Huh?
Can I go inside?
Well, here I go, then.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","What is this place ...?
I thought the insides of a flying ship
would be more mechanical, but ...
It's all old-fashioned, like a deserted house.
I'd better get serious and do a full-blown investigation
or I won't get anywhere.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","Is someone there?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Woah!  You scared me!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","Oh, a human?
And to think she's brought the flying treasure ...
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Flying treasure?
The youkai before was talking about that, too.
What is it, anyway?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","It's treasure that we need to resurrect Hijiri.
We had the mouse out searching for it, but ...
What's she off getting into, anyway?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Mouse ... I think I've seen one recently ...
Oh, that youkai who was talking about eating people?
Hmm, it got on my nerves how she was making fun of humans.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","Oh, where are my manners?
I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.
I'm glad you brought us the flying treasures ...
But I'd rather not have a human that's still
attached to this world onboard.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Hm?  I just came to do some investigation.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","It looks like that ship
is just going back and forth...
It's hard to say it was just patrolling.
It looked like it was chasing me earlier.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","It's not trying to catch you.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","It's looking for a response from the treasure.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Ee!
A mouse, a mouse!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","... huh?
What a disappointing development.
It looks like the treasure responses were coming from you.
Well, I guess if there's a human around here ...

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","I was really just trying to buy time by provoking you
into fighting so you wouldn't leave with the treasure.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Oh, really?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","We'll arrive at our destination soon
safely carrying the treasure.
This ship won't be going back.
It looks like you're a citizen of the demons' land now, too.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","Hmm?
So you came to Makai, too?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Oh, it's the mouse!
The captain was looking for you, you know?
Saying, ""where's she wandering off to now?"" ...

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","Oh?  Really?  Actually, I've had to look
for something else - it's a secret to the captain.
I was looking for the flying treasure you happened to find,
but also for this jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten.
I finally found it in a second-hand goods shop.
It cost me an arm and a leg, though.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Hmm ...
Oh, now I remember.
You were talking about eating people before.
It's payback time now!

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","You're pretty funny.  This pagoda is really my master's,
but let's see how much light it can shine!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","It's hard to believe there's a world like this ...
I couldn't tell where we were going in the ship;
this place seems pretty unstable, though.
Is this the world where demons live ...?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","Yes.
This is Makai.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Huh?  Makai?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","The horrible, unearthly nature of Makai makes it
an unsuitable place for most living creatures.
However, some of the youkai train here,
and humans could learn magic here.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, the one we saw before is down this way.
But, um...
We ought to be careful.
I think we'll be fine, though, since I'm with you.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
My master's power is beyond comparison to mine.
You may have beaten me, but do you think
you're a match for my master?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Overwhelmingly.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Now, let's finish this
before dawn comes.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
I see. So it was you two who were
lengthing the night.
I would've thought that she......

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
This is just like when you made that scarlet mist.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya is doing something weird,
but we're not the ones who're doing the biggest thing right now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
We're on our way to teach that culprit a lesson
right now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Maybe you could fool a bird with that excuse,
but you can't trick me.
Whenever you two move, time stops,
and the night gets longer. 
You two are the culprits who are stopping the night!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Well, yeah. Anything wrong with that?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady.
Stopping the night is not our goal right now.
Look at the moon behind Reimu, please.
See, it's already so...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
That moon's got nothing to do with this unending night, doesn't it?
The night's stopped, and a vampire is running rampant because of it.
What could be more dangerous than that!?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Please, I'm queen of the night,
so at least forgive that.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
I don't think you're helping...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Anyway, I'm going to have you return the passage of time
to normal right here.
Exterminating youkai like you is my job!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
You still don't understand why
we're stopping the night yet, it seems.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, there's no need to hurry here.
As long as you're adjusting the time, at least.
I don't mind her misunderstanding, either.
This is my chance to pay her back for that day.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Well, if you say so, Milady...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
So, are you ready to go back to your coffin?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
I told you before that coffins
are for the dead, didn't I?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
That scarlet, dark and windowless coffin!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
She's fleeing! This way.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Do you think you can escape from my knives?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
How are you not getting lost in this bamboo forest...?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
We're just following you.
You can't escape.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
I was just surprised before, since you both attacked at once.
Now, I'm ready.
Fall into the gap of my boundary!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
I've paid you back.
I'll do you a favor and won't drink your blood,
so go on home.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reimu","
Mmm.
What on earth was your goal in stopping the night?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
You should have asked that before we fought.
We've won now, so there's no need for us
to give an answer.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
...restoring the eternal full moon... (mumbling)

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
We're not restoring it for eternity!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Seija","
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down,
I'll give you a taste of the humiliation the weak have suffered!

","Sakuya_A","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Hey...
Could you stay out of this, Benben?
It's always been my dream to
fight against a human and win, you know.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Well, whatever.
I'll just look for another opponent.
I'll leave the rest to you.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
That seemed too easy.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Well, our ultimate goal isn't
to defeat you, after all.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
What?
What do you want?
This isn't a place
for humans like you.
Leave at once!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I heard that tools who come here
could be granted power.
I would like to hear
the details...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Who is the one spreading all
those silly rumors?
Well, it's not correct, but not wrong either.
But...
That's all because of the ""price"".

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I heard that the youkai that
were docile until now,
and even tools,
have all been receiving power.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
I see... Even on the surface,
changes are happening.
I need to investigate this
""payment"" some more...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Argh, I do not have the time for this!
Just tell me what you are plotting!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Well, it should be okay to
explain to a human.
We are a force of resistance.
We will overturn society and re-draw the political borders of Gensokyo!
It doesn't have much to do with you, since
you humans will end up under our heels.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
A resistance force!?
So what the koto said before
about taking over the world was true.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
If you're joining, I have to give you some power as well.
Should I give it to you?
Or your knife?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Hm?
By ""power""...
You mean the power to change a tool into a tsukumogami?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
That's right!
That's what you came for, right?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Hmm.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Either way, you'll probably
no longer be a human, though.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I see I should just say it outright.
I am a human on the ruling side,
so to me, resistance movements are treacherous.
I cannot support you in your endeavor.
Rather, I am here to subjugate you!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Ahahaha!
I see, you're on the ruling side... How unfortunate.
However, I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the ""Miracle Mallet""!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
The Miracle Mallet...
...Wait, what!?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
I can see it.
A future where the rulers and the ruled are reversed!
Now, my treasured mallet!
Grant the power of dreams to those who are socially weak!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
What do you say?
If you understand, you should leave us be.
The new world will be more comfortable
for humans, after all.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Unfortunately,
I am a human on the ruling side.
To me, a resistance force
means a revolt against us.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
I see...
That's a surprise.
None of you understand
how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed.
So...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down,
I'll give you a taste of the humiliation the weak have suffered!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Ugh.
How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

...Are you alright with this?
Letting her leave, and reach that god?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

I have no idea what in the world
you're talking about!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
By the way, you've come to investigate
the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside
and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making
profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
I really do recommend taking some deep breaths up there.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
A human's here!
See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something
like this up for long...!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Huff... huff...
It's not as bad as that mine shaft from before,
but it's still tough with the thin air up here.
I'm going to get altitude sickness.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Why, what's this?
A curious little thing just showed up.
You're the young miss from that shrine, aren't you?

As you already know, this isn't a place that humans
ought to set foot in so easily.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
You're a tengu-- no, a Great Tengu, aren't you.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Indeed, I am Iizunamaru,
general of the crow tengu.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of
her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a
washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned,
and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
If the Moriya Shrine girl fights her,
we'll benefit no matter which one loses.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
....Hahaha.
I see.
When you betray someone, you don't
do it with your own hands.
A wonderful idea, in my opinion.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
What an unnatural moon.
Even the night being this bright is unusual.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
...And you are?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Chimata Tenkyuu.
I'm the market's main presenter.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
The market's presenter?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special
occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're
all able to buy and sell goods.
Put another way, you're essentially
alive right now because of me.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
I see...?
So what does that all...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Chimata.
I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
What?
Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah!
It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
By which you mean?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I always knew that she was taking
advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize
that I was taking advantage of her right back!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Oho.
How very interesting.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
You're Iizunamaru's pet, aren't you?
Trot on back and tell her.
The market is already open.
None can escape from the hands of God!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Umm.
Did you forget about me?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot.
Now then, shall we begin?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Huh? Begin what?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","Just who are you?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","I am the representative of Bishamonten,
and a devotee of Hijiri's creed.
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought,
as well as the fragments of the Flying Granary you possess,
We can break the seal here.
We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Who is Hijiri?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","Hijiri is a holy person.
As far as I know, she is the most exemplary human
with the most compassionate heart.
Because Hijiri sought the power of Makai,
some foolish humans sealed her away.
Now, come, let us break the seal together.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","What are you talking about?
Were you looking for me?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","Why would I be doing that?
It'd be bad if my little mice got responses from humans.
They're just a bunch of walking stomachs.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Do mice eat humans?
Ahahaha~
Are you for real?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","Yes.  That happens.
You're a pretty strange human
to not be afraid of mice.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Hmm, hmm.
So mice in Gensokyo eat humans.
Maybe it would be nice if 
humans ate mice, too.
... ...
No,
that would be too weird ...

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","Please wait just a minute~
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Yes, what is it?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","Urameshiyaaaaa?!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","... ...
Is this youkai making fun of humans?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","Urameshiya?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Yes, yes.
And out front is a soba store.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","... doesn't looking at me make you surprised?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","In this day and age you can
fly a little helicopter inside someone's room.
These days, nobody would be surprised
by something like a flying umbrella.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","What, you mean I'm behind the times?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Well, you've got that crazy made-up personality.
Even if you didn't, though, ghost umbrellas are kind of behind the times.
Anyway, what's with that umbrella?
It's the same color as an eggplant ...

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","*sniff sniff*
And I did my best to look youkai-like.
I guess I was thrown out because
the design was a little off ... ...
I thought I'd try to get back at the human who threw me away,
and I turned into a youkai ... ...

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Um, excuse me?
Did I say something wrong?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","It's okay.
This is how youkai get lonely and disappear.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","U-um, look, I didn't mean it like that ... ...
It's just, if I got an umbrella like that from a friend,
I just thought maybe I'd rather say no and go home wet ...

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","Fine, if you can't understand the feelings of a youkai like me,
then why don't you just go melt in the acid rain!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","Oh, I can't stand this.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","Please,
leave the treasures here and disembark immediately.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Hm, are you also
trying to make fun of humans?
I won't let you do that!
You all won't take me seriously because Reimu and her friends
are off somewhere goofing around!

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","Does this mean ...
You have no intention of leaving?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","I'll beat you and restore our human dignity!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","Well, then, that's fine.
I was going to fight you to take the treasures by force, anyway.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Reimu","
I'm not gonna like it if it's still night tomorrow.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Sakuya, look.
That mansion...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
You're too late.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
I've sealed all the doors.
You can't take the princess away now, can you?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Is this moon incident
your doing, perhaps?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
She looks shifty.
Especially with that defiant appearance.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Ah, less so than you, winged one.
At any rate, what business do you have here in the middle of this night?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Important business.
This moon incident is because of you folks, isn't it?
They say that if there's a bad smell, clean up its source.
I'm good at cleaning.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
Moon incident?
Mmm, it looks like you've noticed our spell.
Even though you're just impure people
who only crawl around on the Earth.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Unfortunately for you, I'm a filthy creature
who only watches the moon and stars in the sky.
I know when the moon changes, for good or for bad.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
You're quite the night person, Milady.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Restore the full moon to Earth, right now.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Reisen","
There's no way we can undo this spell yet.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Eirin","
My, I thought they just came to pick her up,
but it's just some lost youkai?
Well, there shouldn't be anyone picking her up anyway.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Who're you?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Well, I guess I'm not that hungry right now...

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Good grief. Without the humans from the village,
the only ones left here are youkai and the weird humans!

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"???","
Mmph. What the heck are you?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Remilia","
Bah. There's no end to this now, is there?

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
Milady!
You're toying with her a little too much.

","Remilia_and_Sakuya","Scenario","Imperishable_Night"
"Sakuya","
But you're not a human.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
Well, I wouldn't have an answer even if you'd asked me.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
In days like this,
Cats are supposed to docilely curl up beneath a kotatsu.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
You shouldn't believe such superstitions!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Merlin","
No dish has ever escaped my performance alive.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Hopefully I can make it through okay.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lyrica","
Dog meat, dog meat~

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Human meat!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
I can't afford to waste time in a place like this.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sisters","
It's not time for the flower-viewing yet though.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Flower-viewing would be nice, but spring isn't here yet.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sisters","
About spring, there's plenty of that in the mansion.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
This kind of barrier...
Is simple to bypass.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
You're a human, I see.
Just what I needed.
I shall drain every drop
of the spring from you!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Come on out.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
So this is why everyone here was noisy...
...it's because a living human has come.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Finally, I've reached the source.
It took me a whole day to get here.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
In coming here, you have exercised great composure.
This is Hakugyokurou.
The deceased live on in this place.
Acting on the common sense of the living will land you in a mess.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
I will show no mercy to those
who want to plunge Gensokyo into chaos.
But I doubt you could do much anyway,
considering your level of strength.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Seija","
Not yet.
It's only just begun.
As long as we have that treasure,
we can become as strong as we want.
...As long as we can turn a blind eye to the price.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Ah...
Taking a rest and then fleeing
was a wise choice on her part.
She also said ""we"", so this clearly
is not the work of just one person.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
It seems dawn broke at some point
and the storm also receded.
You could look down and see
all of Gensokyo from here...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Who's theeere?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
A human?
Do you need something?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I heard that there was
a resistance force meeting here.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
My... So you're a supporter?
A human supporter?
I'm so happy!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Shinmyoumaru","
Thanks to the physical traits of the inchlings,
no matter what we do, we're powerless.
There's almost nobody who wants to ally with us.
We're just used, then thrown away.
Even a human or a youkai joining
our cause is great news.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Umm,
actually...
I am trying to stop that plot...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
I often get to perform this impression:
""When a' see a full moon,
a' transform!"" 
......

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
......
So, since I've lost,
I guess I have to surrender unconditionally.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Before you do that...
Do you know if there are other youkai
running amok?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Others?
Well, I'm acting on my own.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Huh?
Were you not conspiring with
that mermaid, that rokurokubi and others?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
A conspiracy..?
I took no part in any such thing.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Hmm... So it is just by coincidence
 that you all became violent at once?
That seems
rather hard to believe...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
All these eerie clouds suddenly
turned up.
It certainly doesn't seem like
a natural phenomenon.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Wait a sec.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Why don't you fight with me?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
There are tsukumogami all the way up here?
All right.
I detect something suspicious, so I accept.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Benben","
Now, now. That's my prey, you know.
Swiping her away is not very admirable behavior.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Yatsuhashi","
Hmmph!
It's your fault for running away.
I saw you fighting her before, anyway.
Your plain, linear music
won't work on her, big sis.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Excuse me,
could you save the sibling rivalry for later?
I can fight you both at once.
It does not matter to me at all.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
So is this what lake cleaning
is like?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"???","
Hey, you!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
You're the one from that mansion on the bank...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
...how strange.
Do all of you want to be
exterminated, perhaps?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
Do you think you can defeat me?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Well, I was ordered to do so...

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
The youkai's day in the sun,
so to speak, has come at last.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Really?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Kagerou","
How many years has it been
since we were told to remain docile?
Enough is enough.
Our time is now!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Chimata","
What do you mean, ""what""...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've
spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Sell them?
Oh, I see.
You're that kind of god?
So you exchange collected cards into money...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Well, more or less.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Hmm, what to do...
About how much are you offering, by the way?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Miss Sanae Kochiya.
Miss Chimata is a god of the marketplace, and of commerce.
However, this marketplace is only open at certain times.
For instance, when a rainbow comes out,
or when there's an intersection with an Otherworld.
I think it would be best if you sold a card,
and received a set profit for it while you still can.
That would be more beneficial for you.
That's what you're here for, isn't it?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
*Gasp!* No, that's wrong!
I came here in order to halt
the circulation of these cards!
You're the god of markets, aren't you?
If that's true, then stop
these cards from circulating right now!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Whoops, you went and said
something you shouldn't have.
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
I cannot halt their circulation.
Why, you ask? Because the rainbow
is already encircling the moon.
To intervene in transactions now
would be blasphemy against the market.
I'm afraid I must have you
disbarred from this marketplace.
Let us return all things to nothing (God) !
By God's invisible hand!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
...You.
That card you're holding...
It's mine...?!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
I bought it by complete mistake...
I feel like crying.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
""Feel like crying?"" Excuse you!
It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
But you've shown me something quite interesting!
It's a shame that you're going to die here!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) !
This marks the end!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Wow, a rainbow!
The way it started raining all of a sudden was just
the worst, but now my heart's as clear as the sky!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Hey, Sis!
Yeah, you over there!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
I've got some nice cards!
Wanna buy any?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
...Looks like I found you nice and fast.
You're one of those card merchants.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
You've already heard? That makes things easy.
I've got some rare cards lined up here! Better act fast.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

I'm actually here to arrest
the card merchants.

Wha?!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Prepare thyself!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Practically everyone's
getting in on the card trade!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Everyone?!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
You haven't heard?
Oh, you're that shrine maiden from the mountain, aren'tcha.
I saw your Ability Card makin' the
rounds too, as a matter of fact.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
My own Ability Card?!
Huh? T-that's...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Defeatin' me won't do you any good.
 There are merchants all over the darn place.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
That's a good point, actually. I've got to
figure out who's making the cards...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
That said, though.
Wanna buy a card off of me?
It could give you some kinda hint!

I can see why you're so strong, then.
Well ... please excuse me
for deceiving you with my talk of disembarking.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Huh?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Of course, I'm a god.
I understand the youkai were all trying to revive you,
but why?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

a tiger, a Ship Phantom, and a Nyuudo?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Mmm, that's about right.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","I see ... so they all
still miss me ...

"Sanae","Help them?
Are you a friend of the youkai?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","A friend ... yes, I suppose I am,
but I'm also a friend to humans.
I want to create a world where humans and youkai live as equals.
I don't know if a god like you could understand,
but I want to see the oppressed youkai regain their status.

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Equals?  Oppressed?
Whichever way you look at it,
humans are the ones being oppressed!
I want to see humans regain their status!

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","I see, it's too bad a living god couldn't see it my way.

Now, in the name of the Three Treasures--!

Even umbrellas won't take me seriously.
It's the end of me ...
What happened to my dignity as a human ...?

I ought to go down and mess up your shrine a little!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Oh, my, you shouldn't be self-destructive.
I'll have to really exterminate you if you do that.

run away at the sight of this fist ... ...

Treasure?  Or my sister's power?

It's very academic.

you're collecting the flying treasure.

The dead tells no tales.
Now, return the spring you stole.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Hold on a bit.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
That's a little bit too long.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Soon, the Saigyou Ayakashi will reach full bloom.
That could never happen with a normal spring.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
I said I don't care.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
The trace of spring you brought here could bring the Saigyou Ayakashi to full bloom.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Are you even listening to me?
I've traveled through that cold only to find such a selfish idea.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
But it's warm here, isn't it?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Where are they?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
Such trifling information rarely concerns me.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
It is not a trifle.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Alright, spill it. Who's behind this whole affair?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
That's enough already.
Dead people have no mouths.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Indeed, dead people have no mouths.
I will consume the warmth of your spring.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
I wonder, can my knives even cut phantoms?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
The things that cannot be cut by my Roukanken, forged by youkai...
are next to none!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Cool. Looks like these knives actually work.
Maybe because they're silver?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
I'm half non-phantom, you know.
But the mistress of this shrine is a fully spirit-bodied.
Do you expect to be a challenge using those obsolete weapons?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Wait, why are we already talking about that battle?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Youmu","
Don't step any further!
Believe me, the young mistress will not hesitate to kill!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
You sure make a lot of noise for someone who's dead.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
You know...
Doesn't this world have a saying that ""the dead have no mouths""?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"???","
Oh?
Of course we don't have any such saying.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
The Netherworld is always lively and gorgeous.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Isn't it gorgeous because you snatched spring away from Gensokyo?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Oh my. You dislike spring?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
No, I'm mad because I LIKE it.
So why did you steal it?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
I took any spring that was spring.
Still, what we have is not enough.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
...So, that dead girl back there wants me to fight you.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Soon, the last cherry blossom, the Saigyou Ayakashi, will bloom.
Then all will be answered...

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
That cherry tree... isn't it withering?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
It's on the verge of blooming.
Youmu must have thought that the small trace of spring you carry would be enough.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
I don't care.
I am worried that it took me over a day to get here.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Well, I'll let you return to your home right away.
You're not to come here yet, anyway.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Let me correct what I said. Not ""to get here,""
but ""to return Gensokyo's spring.""

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Yuyuko","
Oh, could it be that the cherry blossoms in your world have yet to bloom?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
(I didn't know it was just a superstition...)

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

If that were true, then what should stray cats do?

Who should it be but a wolfman.

I'm a wolf-woman!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Ah, my apologies.
I often play pretend-wolfman
at the mansion.

"Kagerou","
Ah, so it seems my kind has some notoriety.
And you're... the vampire's maid?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

A half-fish person!?
I had no idea there was anything else
besides fairies living around this dead lake.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Wakasagihime","
See?
That's how it is.
You've long forgotten about
the existence of us youkai!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
So there were creatures like her
in the neighborhood.
I should take care
when observing from now on.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
There are even youkai running amok
this close to the Human Village...
It seems peace in Gensokyo
is like the Tower of Babel upon sand.

"???","
You showed up fast.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Have you come to exterminate me?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sakuya","
Well, yes.
Since I received an order
to pacify all the rampaging youkai.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
It's useless.
You've come too late.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
The youkai have already begun
to strike back!

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"
"Sekibanki","
Wh-What's with you?
You're actually strong.

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

Did I even once say that
I was weak?

","Sakuya_B","Scenario","Double_Dealing_Character"

I really don't want to,
but I guess I'll retreat for now...

Yes, if you behave yourself,
no one will hurt you.

was strong...

is to rule the world, then?

Really?

I dunno why, but...
Even the youkai who've been docile up until now
have received a strong power too.
That's the kind of world it's turning into.
If that's so, then docile tools would
be the strongest of all, right?

Tools?
What in the world is happening?
Can you
tell me more?

the people of the moon wouldn't
be able to do a thing.

I told you, I'm not from the...

What's an earthling doing here...?
Nobody told me this would happen?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Yeah...
It's all a bit strange for me, too.
This looks like the surface
of the moon, but...
what about the atmosphere and all?
How are our voices being carried?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Mmm...
I don't really know what you're talking about.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
The mountain youkai have been
telling us not to go near here...
I never knew that there was a cliff with such
a mystical atmosphere back here, though!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Oh! You're little Sanae from
the Moriyas' place, after all.
I thought I'd mistaken who you were, back there.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Excuse me, but who are you...?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
I'm Takane Yamashiro, the yamawaro!
I helped you guys out with building your cable car.
So, what brings you here today?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
I'd like to investigate a few things
regarding those Ability Cards...
Oh, it looks like you've
got some cards yourself.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Cards, eh...?
I did think it was only a matter of time
before the Moriya Shrine made their move...
But there's still a lotta money to be made off
of these things. I can't let you take them!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Good grief, you're strong...
But defeating me won't stop
the cards from circulating!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
There's no way to deal with them besides
stamping you out one by one, though...
But I do know that the cards are
spreading out from near the mountain.
I can't just leave things
alone like this.
Right now, my only choice is to find merchants
and gather information from them.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
I see.
How about I sell you some info, then?
Some really, really special info.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Ooh! Gimme, gimme!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Not so fast! I'm not giving it out for free.
It's a very valuable tidbit(card), after all.

Get lost!
You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

My name's Sannyo.
Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.

Right, you're Miss Komakusa-dayuu!
You run a gambling parlor for the tengu, and such.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Oh?
Well, if it isn't the Moriya shrine maiden.
You're not supposed to come up here, right?
You're breaking your promise right now.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Yes, but this is an emergency situation.
There are bizarre cards circulating on the mountain,
and it's disturbing the peace, or some such...
At any rate, it seems that the card
market is centered around here.
I have to collect all the cards
and contain the situation!

Disturbing the peace?
Contain the situation?

I'll have you know that the card market's
a crucial part of the mountain's future.

You Moriya Shrine folks!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

Grh. You're way too strong...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

I'll be having you cooperate with my investigation.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Not bad.
It's no wonder that tengu has a high opinion of you.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
By the way, what's that entrance
I happen to see behind you?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
You haven't heard of the Rainbow Dragon Cave?
It's a cave with a mine full of dreams in it. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Huh? The Rainbow Dragon Cave?
This is the first I've heard of it.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Really?
I could've sworn I heard that the Moriya Shrine
gods had their finger in that pie, too...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Ichirin","I'm sorry, I must have mistaken you for someone else.

I can fulfill my greatest wish!

Are you talking about those charms with
""P"" and ""point"" written on them?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Mmm, it looks like this is just going to
turn into me breaking the seal?


... ...
I'm a little worried about that~
What kind of person is this Hijiri?
But, before that ...
I'm not sure you're such a devoted youkai.
I'll be the one to break that seal.
And I'll take that jeweled pagoda or whatever!

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Shou","Will you?
It would be wonderful if you broke the seal.
However, if your heart is wicked ...

before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

What you're doing is not wrong.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Don't run off with it, okay?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

"Shou","Ah, the wind is blowing into Hokkai for the first time in hundreds of years!
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","Well, the seal's broken now.
I guess it's okay, since it's all investigative.

Lady Suwako should be happy when I get back.

I was a Buddhist monk a long, long time ago.

Actually, I'm also a god, too.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","A god ...?
What would a god be doing in the depths of Makai?
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

and before I knew it, here I was.
","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","Hmm, I see ...
How did you break the seal here?
This seal was a very special seal.
It was sealed with the only piece of treasure
left by my brother, Myouren.
With that treasure buried underground,
I've been completely trapped.
Just how did you break the seal?

","Sanae_B","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"

Why don't you worry about yourself if you have time to worry about others?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Oh yes, I'm worried about myself now.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
So, for what reason do you worry? About yourself.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

Because I'm carrying only three changes of clothes.
 
For myself.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"

Didn't know you were carrying a few.

Do you know who it was that stole spring or sprinkled winter all over this land?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Alice","
I might happen to have some general idea about that.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
No cherry blossoms; not even the pheasant's eyes bloom.

"Yuyuko","
In that case, it'd be troublesome if you developed a heart disease.

It's not.

Well, alright. Enough talk of herbs.
I'm eager to have some warmth.
Return that warmth to us, now.

I bet she's behind all this.

Somehow, I doubt that very much.

Well, joking aside.
Haven't you noticed that the spring follows you as you gather cherry petals?

"Clownpiece","
I'll take you to where our honorable friend is,
so just spare me already?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
No matter how many countermeasures
I work out, you overcome them.
'Tis a shame.
My nemesis was nearly within reach.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
So you're the one invading the Lunar Capital!
Come, let us do battle fair and square!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
...You have not a single blemish.
I admit defeat.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Hwha-wha-whaaa?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
For not one moment did I ever expect
that they would send an earthling to the moon.
I underestimated them.
It seems the battle has already been decided...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Wuh... buh... huh...
Hey! What's that supposed to mean!
Who even are you, anyway!?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon. 
Now, shall we begin our clean-up battle?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Just what is this pent-up frustration I'm feeling?
What do you mean,
I've already won?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
For an uninjured human to arrive at this point,
my current plan must already have failed.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Somehow, I can't agree with that...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
I have underestimated humans.
After all, even the crew of Apollo 11
was covered with wounds.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Huh? Details, please.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
Putting that aside, you will triumph over me.
That is the scenario that has
been constructed by another's hand.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
However, that victory will surely
be accompanied by a nightmare.
Even if we are unable to dwell together under Heaven,
my hatred alone will be refined. 
That this hatred will never touch her
leaves nothing for me but vexation!
In exchange, I'll vent myself against you, such that your
victory, the outcome of this cruel fate, may be realized!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
No matter how many countermeasures
I work out, you overcome them.
However, it seems your foolish
scheme has ended in failure.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
So you're the one invading the Lunar Capital!
Come, let us do battle!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Yes, to think that you could do battle
with me was absurd.
The people of the moon escape into a dream,
and send an earthling to deal with me.
I thought it to be a daring plan,
but I suppose I overestimated them.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
What's that supposed to mean?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
A human so completely surrounded by the
stench of death can never hope to defeat me.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
W-w-w-what?
I haven't heard anything about that!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Hey, hey, you can't go in there.
It's more dangerous than you'd ever believe!
I don't care how strong you are.
It's an awful environment for humans to be in.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
No, I simply have to investigate this.
So if you have any good cards, I'd like to buy one!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Heh. Well, alright.
You'd better be real careful in there.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
What is this place...?
I wonder if they're digging up something like coal?
They sure are lagging behind here...
Even though we're already in the age of nuclear fusion.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You there, human!
Stop at once!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
You'll die if you proceed any further.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
Turn around and leave, right now!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Who are you!?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
My name is Tamatsukuri,
Young Sanae Kochiya.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
So already you seem to know who I am.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Yes, of course I do...
So let me repeat my warning once again.
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease
to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Anoxic!?
I had a bad feeling about this mine shaft
from the start, but are there toxic gases too?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Humans will quickly suffocate in any anoxic environment.
Whether there are toxic gases or not
won't change the end result...
But yes, the shaft is indeed filled with toxic gas.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Really?
Is it carbon monoxide or something, I wonder?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Are you not scared?
Have you forgotten that you might die?
Even though I warned you that
lingering here would cause your demise?
Death by asphyxiation is a highly unpleasant way to go.
Might I recommend a more palatable method!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Hm, not bad.
I certainly didn't expect you
to be this strong.
Young Sanae Kochiya.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
...W-what is this...?
I can't... breathe...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
I told you, didn't I?
That you'd suffocate if you stayed here?
The oxygen levels are already about half of that on the surface.
It seems that your brash show of skill
has led you to forget your sense of danger.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
...Just let me know one thing.
What exactly are you mining here?
Gold? Silver? Coal? Iron?
Bauxite? Or even Uranium?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
*Chuckle*.
This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects
that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before
the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
I'm sorry for trespassing in the domain
of the tengu without permission.
However, as the origin of these cards
seems to be somewhere on our mountain,
I have no choice but to enter tengu
territory in order to investigate them.

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Are you talking about the Ability Cards?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Yes, exactly!
Do you happen to know anything?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
I don't just ""happen to know"" about them.
I created them, as a matter of fact!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Huh? What did you say!?

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
There you are!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Yuyuko","
I doubt that some troublesome individual is about to make a return,
or that there's any secrets or anything in,
say, the cemetery behind the temple...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Hm?
A-anyway, I'll be off.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yuyuko","
Bring me back a souvenir!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
This temple has quite a lot of youkai about.
Could these odd spirits, too,
be the work of the temple monk?
That isn't a very satisfying explanation, though.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
That's dangerous!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
What are you doing, swinging
sharp objects on the pilgrimage path?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
It's fine, isn't it?
They're just youkai and fairies.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
The temple has a strict ban on killing!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Um, er, well,
not like I was gonna slice them until they were killed...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
Anybody swinging around sharp swords
and committing unneccesary killing in the temple...
...is to die here!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
You youkai are as energetic as ever...
So, would you happen to know anything
about the divine spirits?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kyouko","
What's a divine spirit?
Does it taste good?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
...as expected.
Only a shrine would benefit from gathering divine spirits.
I can't help but feel this isn't the work of a youkai...
But even if these formless spirits materialize,
they'll just vanish right away.
They're nothing but essence of greed that's visible to the eyes
at this point...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
What do you want?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kogasa","
Ah, someone swinging swords around...
Oh, anybody'll do!
I saw this girl I've never
seen before keeping watch back there.
But no matter how much I shoot her,
I always lose by time out...
So hey, do something about her?
Pleeease.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Plead of help from a youkai?
How bizarre.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Kogasa","
Heh heh heh!
But we'll have to test if you're tougher than me!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Well, Lady Yuyuko told me to
go to the cemetery, but...
Although she may not have actually said it...
Anyway, the spirits are really making a racket.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Dooon't come any closeeer!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
This is no place for
the likes of you to enter!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Ah, hello.
...Are you already dead?
Maybe you're decayi...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
We are fighters (jiang shi) , arisen to protect
 this magnificent mausoleum.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Uh? Jia...?
Ah, jiang shi, I see.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Right, so knowing that, you should leave.
Or otherwise become one of our companions.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Companions...? Sorry to say,
but I'm actually in a similar state already.
But to still be loitering around this world
because of a few lingering attachments...
I feel sorry for you.
Huh?
Something feels... off.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
We aren't stuck in this world
because we have attachments!
It is all so that she shall not be
trampled upon by the temple's inhabitants again!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Whaaaaat!!?
I'm dyiiiiing!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Yes, yes, we get it, you're already dead.
A jiang shi with a charm stuck on her head...
That must mean there's a master controlling you.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Was there?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Of course, you also reeked of
the possibility of such earlier...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Huh? I stink?
But I take such good care of my skin.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Sigh, zombie jokes...
Well anyways, I'll go search around for who's controlling you.
I'm sure they'll have clues for me.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Merlin","
Well, perhaps it might be enough for a petit banquet?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
What?  Are you going to have a flower viewing party after this, or something?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Merlin","
Yes, we shall.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lunasa","
Before that, we might be able to get a hold of stuff for the banquet.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lyrica","
It is the eve feast of the flower-viewing festival.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Sounds like fun.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Lunasa","
You are to serve us as food.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
I'm not sure I'm qualified.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Ahhhhh, killing the small fry is so pointless!
I wish the one pulling the strings would show up already.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Letty","
Pulling strings, what fun~

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Ahh, so you're the one?

Well then, without delay.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Letty","
No, wait!

I'm the mastermind, but I'm normal.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Mastermind or normal doesn't matter in such a place.
Don't you think this situation isn't normal to begin with?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Letty","
The snow crystals are larger than in past years.

Three times larger.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Well, that's true.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Letty","
On top of that, there's a freaky flying maid coming towards me.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Yeah, that too.

After all, you're the mastermind.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
That was pitiful.
I'm gonna find the next mastermind, then.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
Is it really spring now?
This just doesn't make any sense at all!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Chen","
In that case, you'd better ask a human for help!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Perfect_Cherry_Blossom"
"Sakuya","
*Chuckle*. I suppose so.
I'll pay full price, so give me everything you have.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Pleasure doin' business with you!
...Is what I'd like to say.
But you can only buy one card per transaction.
Didn'tcha know that?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Huh?
Why's that...?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Mike","
Beats me.
I heard it's somethin' the bigwigs decided.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Hmm...
Thank you very much for the useful information.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
It's been a while since I climbed up the mountain by myself.
I hardly expected the Youkai Mountain to have
such a perfect sheer cliff for rock-climbing.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Oh! You're a human after all.
I thought I'd mistaken what you were, back there.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Oh. A kappa?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
I'm a yamawaro, not a kappa! A yamawaro.
We're pretty similar, though.
This is no place for humans to be skulking around.
So get outta here, quick!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I'm afraid that won't be happening.
After all, I can see that
you've got cards of your own.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Cards, eh...?
I guess you've been sniffing around for them after all.
These are too much for you puny little humans to handle!
Begone from our mountain!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Good grief, you're strong...
But it's too bad for you!
Cards can't be taken through violence.
Those are the rules.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Nobody said anything about taking them via violence.
If you want money, I have it.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
Ooh! If you're a customer,
then that's quite a different story!
Honestly, you should've said that first.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
You're the one who got the
wrong idea and attacked me.
I had always intended to purchase them.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Yes, I am.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Just what kind of motive would you have for making these things?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Junko","
My name is Junko.
With my power of purification,
I am able to kill you unconditionally.
Just how many mistakes have you
suffered on the way here?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
By 'mistakes', you mean getting shot?
Well, about, uh...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
So, what are you going to do?
If you want to,
you can go forward from here.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Ringo","
I like the Earth(this place), though,
so I'll stay here.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Ah, I'm flying through space!
I'm really flying right now!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Oh, my.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
It seems you're having quite the nightmare.
I'll just help myself to it... wait.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
Is that your physical body!?
You're having a nightmare in the flesh!?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
I'm flying through space like I've always wanted.
If this is a nightmare, what would even count as a good dream?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
If your body is hit by nightmare fragments(space debris),
it won't be pleasant.
I ought to send you back to reality right away.
Even just your body, at least.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Uh, so, I don't really understand what's going on,
but a rabbit told me that this is the way to the Lunar Capital.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
The Lunar Capital...
Oh-ho, I see now.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
Very well.
I will dispose of this lunatic dream.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
Now, sleep.
I will craft your Kaian now.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
I have helped myself to
your delicious nightmares.
However, if you still intend
on going to the Lunar Capital,
your mind will surely be eroded by a nightmare
many times greater than before.
It is worthy of being called
a 'lunatic dream'.
Right now, you can still ""wake up and
find out that it was only a dream""...
Will you still proceed, despite that?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
I know this question.
And I know the answer to it.
You'll just keep saying 'but thou must!'
no matter how many times I say no, right?
So the answer is ""yes""!
I am going to the Lunar Capital!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Doremy","
I see...
In that case, I wish you good dreams.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Ever since Apollo 17 landed on the Moon, there hasn't been
a manned expedition for over 40 years.
With a chance like this right in front of me,
there's no way I'll let it end with ""it was all just a dream""!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
So there's an advanced civilization on the moon;
NASA knows about it, but is concealing it.
I remember hearing an urban legend
like that once.
Seeing this, I guess I can't say it was
entirely an urban legend in the end, huh...?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
......

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Are you one of the moon's people?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Excuuuse me...
Helloooo...?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
(Maybe her hearing's bad.)

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...That's not it.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Aah, that gave me a fright.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
I was just trying to think of a reason
why a human would be on the moon.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
So you are a lunar citizen...
I've actually got a lot of questions
for you.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
(Could it be you're ignoring me?)

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
...That's not it.
Nothing is settled yet,
so there's no way I'll say anything!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Tsukasa","
See, things turned out just like I said they would.
A human would be sure to come snooping up here eventually!
I suppose we have no choice by now.
I shall deal with this human myself.
So in the meantime, Master Iizunamaru, you can...

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
Ah-hah-hah!
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You're too confident in your own strength,
despite being a weakling.
If you got injured, I'd be
the one troubled by it.
I'll deal with her.
You get back!

","Sanae","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Nothing's going to be solved
by me chasing this flying ship...
I think I saw some weird fairy earlier,
I wonder if that had any special meaning...?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
There was a reaction from the treasure around here......

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Eek!
You scared me. Are you that mouse from before?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Oh, it's that human, isn't it?
Hm, maybe I was wrong.
Please don't get in the way of my work.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Your work?
But you're just a mouse.
Just a mouse that couldn't make it through the winter,
even after eating all the rice in our storeroom...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
What are you saying?
Don't make fun of us mice!
... huh.
It looks like that reaction was coming from you.
That's really disappointing.
I guess I'll go look for treasure somewhere else.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
That's right,
We shouldn't make fun of even mice.
They are a precious living being required for
scientific experiments in the outer world.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Nazrin","
Sorry, but if you don't take us mice seriously,
you'll die.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
You're quite a worthy youkai yourself.
That was pretty satisfying.
I hope all the youkai from here on out
are like you.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Ichirin","
If you're not going to give me
the floating gems you've found...
Then, you want to revive her
on your own, right?
Well, please, go right on ahead inside!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yep, there's definitely
some great youkai to hunt inside.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Hmm.
There's nobody here but fairies......
I was expecting a youkai hideout to be more active
with stronger enemies.
Even all the ornaments are old-fashioned and plain...
Isn't there anyone here?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Is someone there?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
There you are.
Speak of the devil!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
And who are you?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
I've come to exterminate youkai.
My name is Sanae Kochiya.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
I'm Murasa, the captain of the Palanquin Ship.
We don't need any youkai exterminators at the moment.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Oh, you're the captain?
Is it okay for you to be wandering around a place like this?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
Yes, the ship is headed for its destination
automatically now.
Actually, there's not much for me to do as captain these days.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
I see, it's kind of like the bullet trains.
Well, then, I'd better hurry up and...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
And what?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Well, ummm, you know, exterminate youkai.
You're a youkai, aren't you?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
I am!
But, that troublesome youkai hunting of yours will be over soon.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Huh?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
The future that Hijiri wants
is a peaceful, beautiful youkai world.
And, we'll be able to break Hijiri's seal
with the treasure you've brought.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Huuh? A world without youkai hunting?
That's not good.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Yoshika","
My... master??
What the...
Wait, does that mean
that dreadful religious war is upon us once again?!
...Er, who was that?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Here...
My spirit-detecting radar is getting a signal!
Yes, this place is a tomb.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Welcome.
Ah, you're...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
We just met back there, right?
Who are you?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
I'm Seiga Kaku.
I'm currently living as a hermit.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
A hermit...
Ummm, that would mean...?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
A hermit is a hermit.
Perpetual youth, a clear mind, a sturdy body.
It seems you're the same sort of being.
You've transcended life and death, haven't you?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
No, uh, I can die.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Yoshika","
Die, you say!?
Dying's no good.
Anything but that.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Oh, my, you're back quick.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
My oh my.
You resurrected quickly.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
...What's that?
You've got a grudge against this person in front of us?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
So, will it be another round?
With this girl who has absorbed all the divine spirits that gathered in the tomb.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
So you're that thing's master!
That saves me some time!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
My faithful servant.
Go eradicate the one who would deny this resurrection!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
Oh, my, my, my, how splendid.
The people of Gensokyo truly are talented.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Well, I am strong after all.
Now, I have something to ask you.
These divine spirits gathering here...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
It's okay, it's okay.
The preparations should've ended right about now.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Preparation? For what?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
These spirits that look like divine spirits
are actually just common desires.
If you leave them be, they'll disappear soon.
They won't do any harm.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Seiga","
She will be revived very soon.
Compared to that foreign prophet who resurrected
three days after his execution...
...this will be much more divine and magnificent.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
I don't know what you're scheming, but...
...the dead being resurrected can't be
anything but a bad thing!
...or so I think so.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
This is quite a big tomb.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Aah, this fateful day hath finally come.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Thou who hast blessed my resurrection: speak now, and name yourself.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Whoops,
there's something in here.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Thou art... inhuman, it wouldst seem.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Mmph, your body is covered
with the stench of death.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Aye, for I art no longer among the living.
We are of a like kind, are we not?
Art thou not also a shikaisen?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Huh? No, I'm not.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
...Come again?
I s-see. Then I have judged thee in error.
Thou hast mine apologies.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
You're a shikaisen...?
Then you're in league with that wicked hermit from just now.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Aye, and? What wouldst thou do?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Defeat those who rebel against the natural order
and return them to the ground!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
Alas.
And I had thought thee a kindred soul to me.
Thou who thinkest thou couldst return this fusion of the secret art of the Mononobe
and the way of the Tao into the ground, come now and attempt such a thing with all thy might!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
What is this?
It wouldst seem thou art truly no ordinary being.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Yep, I'm no ordinary being?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
For my defeat to have come to pass so readily...
Thou must truly be a hermit of great fame.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Megumu","
My motive...?
Why, they're my latest
business venture, obviously.
It seems that people are quite enjoying them,
so I'm in a rather cushy spot right now myself.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Hmph, typical tengu.
Simply the height of immorality.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Takane","
I do beg your pardon~!
Here you go. They're all only available now!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
The hell's all this racket...?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
Get lost!
You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You followed me all this way, huh?
Guess you're not just
some ordinary rioter...

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
And who might you be?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
My name's Sannyo.
Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.
And who are you?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I'm searching for card merchants at the moment.
I imagine you're selling cards as well?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Heheh.
Your name first, if you don't mind.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I do apologize.
I'm Sakuya Izayoi.
I work as a maid at the Scarlet Devil Mansion

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Bahaha!
I got the feeling you weren't someone to sneeze at.
But you're just some human maid?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
If you want some, go buy 'em from a merchant in the foothills!
Get lost right now.
You're 80 years too early to even think of buyin' from me!
And if you won't leave,
I'll chase you off with brute force.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Grh. You're way too strong...
I get it, I get it.
You're strong. I'll sell ya some cards.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Why, thank you.
By the way, where might that entrance
behind you happen to lead?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
This?
It's the entrance to the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
It's a cave with a mine full of dreams in it. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Rainbow Dragon Cave...
A mine...
This is the first I've heard of it.
Are you digging for coal, perhaps?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Hey, hey, you can't go in there.
It's more dangerous than you'd ever believe!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Thank you for the heads-up.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sannyo","
Well, if you insist on goin' in...
What do you say?
I've got some pretty good cards.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
This mine shaft is
far too long...
No matter how far I go,
it all looks the same, too...
*Gasp!*
Could I be looping in place?!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"???","
You there, human!
Stop at once!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
You'll die if you proceed any further.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
Turn around and leave, right now!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
I suppose I'm not looping, then.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Looping... True, this shaft certainly
is long enough to feel endless.
But that's nothing more than someone's
insatiable desire, taken form.
I'll warn you one more time.
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease
to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Anoxic, you say?
...Remind me what ""oxygen"" is?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Oxygen is a curse placed on animals, which
causes them to instantly die in its absence.
An anoxic zone is a sanctuary that's
protected from animals' intrusion.
You're bound to die of suffocation there too,
but I really suggest dying in a more pleasant way, you know?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Misumaru","
Hm, not bad.
I certainly didn't expect you
to be this strong.
Young Sakuya Izayoi.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
?!
How do you know... who I am...?
But I've walked right into a trap.
I can't breathe...

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sanae","
Just attacking someone out of the blue like that
is really rude, you know!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
I'm sorry that I had to
test you like that.
I've decided now.
Let's talk about everything.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Haah... So, what are you trying
to do in Gensokyo?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
As you can see, the Lunar Capital
is frozen right now.
This is a defense against a certain
enemy's invasion,
but as she controls the source of life,
we're unable to act against her plans.
Because we people of the moon
reject life and death, you see...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
We can't just leave things
frozen like this either,
so just as insurance, I created
the Gensokyo Capital Relocation Plan.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Relocation?
Er, what's that?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
Moving.
Although we're better off not doing it.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Ahh, I see.
The Lunar Capital has it tough, too.
Well, Gensokyo's a nice place,
so maybe it'd be okay if you moved there.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
Is that so...?
Perhaps I miscalculated a little.
I would have thought that you were acting
at Lady Yagokoro's suggestion.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Ah, well, uh...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sagume","
But it's too late for that.
I am Sagume, a being who can change
the world's course with my words.
Now that I've gone and talked about it,
fate will begin to change again.
The relocation will surely not come to be.
I have no choice but to bet the fate of the Lunar Capital on you.
There's no escape any more.
Fate has at last begun to reverse.
Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Kyahahahaha!
Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies!
Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic tiiiime!
Welcome to a world of madness!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
I think just going with the flow
has left me in an unbelievable situation...!
Well, putting that aside,
to summarize that conversation just now...
""You're the only one who can
save the Lunar Capital!""
That's about right, isn't it?
I guess this means everyone's
relying on me, huh?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
You got past all the fairies
bathed in my torchlight.
You must really be something!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
I won't lose!
Saving the Lunar Capital is my destiny!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"???","
Oho, is that right?

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
I'm a fairy from hell,
Clownpiece.
The moon's people are enemies of honorable friend.
Enemies of honorable friend are enemies of Master's.
And any enemy of Master's is an enemy of mine!
I'll show no mercy.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Uh, no,
I'm not from the...

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Clownpiece","
Tooooo late.
I was told I could do whatever I want
to anyone who came from the Lunar Capital.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
An uncountable number, I'm sure.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
Well, yeah. A couple shots here and there are
fine, aren't they? I'm only human, after all.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Junko","
The moon's people, too, have committed a foolish mistake. 
It seems this earthling is far
more weak than you all thought.
My stagnated engagement with the people of the moon
was just beginning to exhaust my interest. 
My mortal enemy, Chang'e. Are you watching!?
Gaze upon the lunar citizens' foolish plan, and upon this impure human!

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Sanae","
I'm sure I've seen that
probe-looking thing around here.

","Sanae","Scenario","Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom"
"Murasa","
If you stay on board with the treasure you have,
we can take you along to Makai.
We'll be there before long.
I won't let you get away!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
I can see you're not just in this business for show.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
What's the treasure I've got?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
They're objects that can fly on their own.
They used to be part of a grain silo, though...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Oh, so it's not a UFO-shaped toy?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
UFO?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Ummm, let's see, what was it?
Unidentified flying object, right?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Murasa","
Yes, it's exactly that.
That's our flying treasure, the fragments of the Flying Granary.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
So the UFOs were actually parts of a grain silo.
Those magazines I used to read tricked me...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yes, I hunt youkai who
do bad things to people.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
...... I see humans haven't changed.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
I'm sorry?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
I grieve for the youkai
that are oppresed by humans.
I did everything in my power to create a peaceful world
where humans and youkai could live as equals.
And yet, I was sealed away by humans
who didn't want that sort of world.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Humans and youkai, as equals?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Yes. Gods and buddhas are no different from youkai.
Yet, why are youkai reviled and hunted,
while gods are worshipped?
It is only because humans want it to be so.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Did you say gods and youkai aren't any different?
That's not true at all!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Do you believe hunting youkai is just?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yes, of course!
We have to hunt youkai to keep the peace!
That's what Lady Kanako said, too!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
I see; then, as someone who's given up on humans...
I suppose you would see me no different than a youkai.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Then, I guess it's time to beat you!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Byakuren","
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple.
You're only blindly following her, how superficial!
Now, namusan --!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Oh!
So this is youkai hunting!
......
This is kind of fun.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Hang on just a minute~

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yes, what is it?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"???","
Booooooo?!

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
......
Er, did you need something?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
......
Oh, I'm so lonely.
Won't you at least be a little surprised?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Well, I guess I'm used to things like that.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Aw, and we youkai are
doing our best to surprise humans...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Hmm? I heard you were doing your best
to eat humans......

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Well, there are youkai that eat meat,
and there are youkai who eat your spirit.
If you humans don't get surprised by me,
I'll get hungry.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
That must be hard on you. But, well, since I'm starting to see
how this is fun, getting surprised would be...

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Fun?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Yes, how fun youkai hunting is.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Kogasa","
Oh, what's the point of youkai who can't surprise people?

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Sanae","
Well, now, please don't get so down.

","Sanae_A","Scenario","Undefined_Fantastic_Object"
"Youmu","
I'm telling you, I'm not a hermit.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Thou needest not play at humility.
Didst thou not come to bless
the Crown Prince's resurrection as well?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
...
(Maybe it's better if I
play along at this point.)
T-that's right.
I've come to deliver a blessing.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Futo","
I understand, I understand.
For wouldst not a blessing from one so powerful as thee
be an event worthy of lauding?
Now, come this way...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
I fooled that person back there to get in
by saying I was a hermit...
Still, this is the first tomb I've seen
that was so full of vitality.
And these divine spirits-- no, they're just
materialized incarnations of desires, apparently.
Vulgar spirits... the low grade spirits among the living spirits. 
Who could stand to gain something from gathering these things here...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
No. They have gathered of their own volition.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
Desires gather at my side.
In every single era.
Because I was made to listen to ten desires
at once every day, I'm sure.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"???","
...Hmm?
You lack two desires.
From among the ten that I expected,
your attachment to life and your envy of death are...

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Sorry, but I'm afraid that
I'm already half-dead.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
Is that right? Then you and I are comrades, are we not?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Huh?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"

Those who walk a path toward eternal life as its endpoint?
Well, although you may already be a hermit
or a shikaisen.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
No, no, no, no.
I just denied being a hermit a second ago.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
There's no need to hide it.
I see and understand all.
All that can be understood from seeing human desire.
Regrettably, your desires are lacking,
and therefore incomplete.

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
Wait, no! I'm telling you, that's not it?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
As a comrade, you understand
what will happen next, don't you?

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Youmu","
No, I don't!

","Youmu","Scenario","Ten_Desires"
"Miko","
Two beings revived to eternal life
must join together in combat, and join together in study of the Tao!

And I will be resurrected
as a statesman of eternal life!

Have at it!

Please let me handle this!

headed in the direction of the village.

Where are you going at this time of night?

Ah, Lady Yuyuko!
I was thinking of going to investigate these divine spirits.

So this is the curse on this place...
Let me ask one last thing.
...What are you digging up here?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects
that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before
the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.
I happen to craft genuine magatamas
from these dragon gems.
The ""tama"" in ""magatama"" refers to a human's soul.
As such, they can seal humans' abilities within them...

"Misumaru","
Oh, my sincerest apologies.
By the way, you've come to investigate
the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside
and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making
profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
I really do recommend taking some deep breaths up there.

Immoral?
I just copied a small part of people's souls.
They shouldn't be posing any harm to anyone...

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Harm, hm...?
This isn't getting me anywhere.
They're unpleasant, so would you mind recalling all of them?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
I can't do that.
The cards' circulation can't be stopped; not by me, at least.
Because everyone who's taking part in the card trade
just started doing so of their own accord.
And I'm not the one controlling
their circulation, either.
If you do seriously want to stop that circulation, I suggest
you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
...Alright. You don't seem to be lying.
Thanks for the information.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
...Are you alright with this?
Letting her leave, and reach that god?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Megumu","
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of
her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a
washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned,
and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
I'm sure that girl just now will do a good job for us.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
....Hahaha.
I see.
When you betray someone, you don't
do it with your own hands.
A wonderful idea, in my opinion.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Tsukasa","
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"

My, what a beautiful moon.
She said ""even higher in the sky,""
but I certainly hope she didn't mean the moon.
The scary part is that that's actually plausible.

Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
...Who?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Chimata Tenkyuu.
I'm the market's main presenter.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
The market's presenter...
Good, I've finally found you.
You're the one in charge of
the cards' circulation, then?

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Chimata","
Quite so!
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special
occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're
all able to buy and sell goods.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
In that case, I'd like you to halt
circulation of these cards.

","Sakuya","Scenario","Unconnected_Marketeers"
"Sakuya","
Why, it's a rainbow.
I'd love to show this to Milady as well.
